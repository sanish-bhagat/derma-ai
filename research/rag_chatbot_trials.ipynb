In ve rtebrates, pigmentation var-\\nies widely from black and white stripes of zebra to muted \\nbrowns in sparrows to bright colors of tropical fish. Thus, \\nthe pigmentation system has served as a model for a wide \\nvariety of studies providing some connections between \\ngenotype and phenot ype for evolutionary important pig-\\nmentation traits. Skin color primarily depends on the func-\\ntions of melanocytes, the cells specialized in the synthesis \\nand distribution of the melanin pigment. In the epidermis, \\neach melanocyte is connected through its dendrites with \\napproximately 30 ∼40 keratinocytes, establishing the \\nso-called epidermal melanin unit\\n1, and to fibroblasts in the \\nunderlying dermis. Within melanocytes, melanin synthesis \\noccurs in specialized membra ne-bound organelles termed \\nmelanosomes, characterized by four stages of maturation, \\nalong with they gradually become pigmented. Specialized \\nmelanogenic enzymes within melanosomes, tyrosinase \\nand tyrosinase-related ones, di rect the production of two \\nmelanin types: bl ack-brown eumelanins, the major pig-\\nment found in dark skin and hair, and yellow/red pheome-\\nlanin, mainly observed in red hair and I/II skin photo-\\ntypes\\n2. The number of melanocytes is relatively com-\\nparable among diffe rent ethnicities 3,4 and variations in \\nskin color are mainly dependent on the type (the relative \\nquantity of pheo and eumelani ns) and the amount of mel-\\nanin produced within melanosomes. Size, quantity, dis-\\ntribution and degradation of these structures in the sur-\\nrounding keratinocytes are also determinants in ethnic col-'),\n",

Moreover, \\nthe ratio between pheo and eu melanins appears higher in \\ndark versus light skins (Fig. 1) 7. Besides the underlying bi-\\nological bases, variation in human skin and hair color is \\nthe most notable aspect of human variability and explain-\\ning which mechanisms support differences in skin color \\nacross the world’s populations has been one of the central \\nquestions of human biology. The association of dark skin \\npigmentation with intense su nshine and heat was postu-\\nlated by Aristotle into a “climatic theory” which related \\nhuman features to the environm ent. Later, naturalists such \\nas John Mitchell and Samuel Stanhope Smith related dif-\\nferences in skin pigmentation of world’s people (from light \\ntoward the poles to dark near the equator) to the lat-\\nitudinal gradient sunshine heat\\n8,9. Today we can say more \\nprecisely that variations in sk in color are ad aptive and re-\\nlated to ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels, correlate with lat-\\nitude and represent a solution to the physiological require-\\nments of photoprotection and vitamin D synthesis\\n10. \\nIt is likely that the integument of early members of the \\nhominid family was white or lightly pigmented and cov-\\nered with dark hair. The evolution of a naked, darkly pig-\\nmented integument occurred to protect sweat glands from \\nUV-induced injury thus ensuri ng the quality of somatic \\nthermoregulation. The migratio n of hominids outside of \\nthe tropics placed pressure on skin pigmentation levels be-\\ncause of lower and more seasonal levels of UV. \\nSimultaneously, many degrees of depigmentation evolved \\nto allow UV-B-induced synthesi s of vitamin D. Therefore, \\nthe range of pigmentation ob served in modern humans \\nevolved to favor photoprotectio n near the equator and to \\npromote cutaneous UV-R-induced vitamin D synthesis \\ncloser to the poles. \\nSeveral studies in population genetics have allowed to ex-\\nplain the evolution of human pigmentation system. \\nHowever, the genetics of pigmentation is complex: many \\ngenes, that have been identified for decades by using \\nmouse coat color mutations (and more recently zebrafish), \\nare responsible for the range of pigmentation phenotypes \\ncontributing to human skin pi gment diversity seen both \\nbetween and within human populations\\n11.

Such genome-wide scans have \\nboth confirmed a role for genes previously identified as \\ncandidates in human pigmen tation and highlighted new \\nloci, thus determining more than one hundred genes that \\nregulate human pigmentary system either directly or \\nindirectly. The expression of such genes is not necessarily \\nconfined to melanocytes\\n12,13.\\nMelanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1R), a G protein-coupled re-\\nceptor that regulates the quantity and quality of melanins \\nproduced, was the first gene identified in humans that is \\ninvolved in regulating mammalian skin and hair color\\n14. It \\nworks by controlling the type  of melanin being produced, \\nand its activation causes the switch from phaeomelanin to \\neumelanin. Mc1R is preferen tially expressed in melano-\\ncytes but not exclusively limited to them since low levels \\nof Mc1R are also detected in  keratinocytes, fibroblasts, \\nand immune cells\\n15. Several studies showed that Mc1R is \\nhighly polymorphic in Nort hern European populations, \\nwhereas is almost without any functionally significant var-\\niation in African populations demonstrating the action of \\nselection to maintain dark pigmentation in high-UV-R en-\\nvironments\\n16,17.\\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS IN THE CONTROL \\nOF SKIN PIGMENTATI ON AND DEFENCES: \\nDERMAL-EPIDERMAL CROSS-TALK\\nThe development and evolution of such a complex pig-\\nmentary system required a fine  and integrated regulation \\nof signalling pathways and cellular interactions. Several \\nautocrine/paracrine secreted  factors and cell adhesion \\nmechanisms involving both epidermal and dermal con-\\nstituents, regulate melanocyte homeostasis, determining \\nthe constitutive skin pigmenta tion and, whenever deregu-\\nlated, the occurrence of pigm entary disorders. Some of \\nthese messengers are produced by both the epidermal and \\ndermal cells, whereas others are distinctly synthesized by \\nonly one type of ce ll. UV exposure is the main environ-\\nmental factor influencing sk in pigmentation. Following \\nUV irradiation, pigment redistribution in keratinocytes and \\nskin is stimulated, melanogenesis is increased and the syn-\\nthesis and secretion of many pro-pigmenting factors are \\nup-regulated. All these factors act by binding to their spe-\\ncific receptors followed by activation of intracellular sig-\\nnalling pathways linked to melanocyte functionality. \\nAmong such growth factor/receptor signalling cascades, \\none of the main pathway is constituted by the pro-opiome-\\nlanocortin (POMC) derived peptides (melanocyte-stimulat-\\ning hormone [MSH] and adrenocorticotropic hormone) \\nfrom keratinocytes and their receptor Mc1R. Following \\nUV exposure the transcription of POMC is stimulated by \\nthe induction of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in kera-\\ntinocytes, thus promoting me lanin synthesis in melano-\\ncytes via paracrine interactions\\n18. As previously men-\\ntioned, Mc1R mutations, which are more frequently ob-\\nserved in light than in dark skin phototypes, may dereg-\\nulate the cellular responses to α-MSH, resulting in de-\\ncreased eumelanin production in both constitutive and \\nUV-mediated pigmentation.\\nAlong with α-MSH, melanocyte growth, differentiation, \\nsurvival and activity are re gulated by other keratino-\\ncyte-derived growth factors and cytokines including endo-\\nthelin (ET)-1, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), stem \\ncell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulat-\\ning factor (GM-CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). As \\nwell as α-MSH, most of these messengers are up-regu-\\nlated in response to UV: ET-1 binds to its specific receptor \\nendothelin B receptor on melanocytes but it also enhan-\\nces the expression of Mc1R\\n19. Its effect results in the in-\\ncrease of both melanocyte proliferation and melano-\\ngenesis\\n19,20 and, as for POMC, ET-1 synthesis is induced \\nby p5321. Upon specific stimuli, e.g. during inflammatory \\nprocesses, several other me diators, including prosta-\\nglandins E2 and F2alpha, thromboxane B2, leukotriene \\n(LT) C4 and LTD4 are released by the surrounding micro-\\nenvironment and activate melanocytes increasing their \\ndendricity and melanin production\\n22. Adding complexity \\nto the interplay between keratinocytes and melanocytes, a \\ncontribution of the eumelanin intermediate 5,6-dihydrox-\\nyindole-2-carboxylic acid, which goes beyond the supply-\\ning of pigments, has been s hown: the diffusion of this \\nchemical messenger from the producing melanocytes into \\nkeratinocytes may provide protection against environ-\\nmental stimuli such as UV, through the increase of the an-\\ntioxidant defence systems and differentiation in keratino-\\ncytes, thus contributing to the overall epidermis pro-\\ntection23. \\nSome studies highlight the role of beta defensins, small \\nand hydrophobic members of highly conserved gene fami-\\nlies exhibiting antimicrobial activity against a variety of \\ngram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, yeast and vi-\\nruses, in mediating also human pigmentation. More pre-\\ncisely, some results expand the functional role of beta de-\\nfensins revealing the cross-talk between beta defensins \\nand the melanocortin system. In  fact, at least two human \\nbeta defensins, human β-defensin (hBD) 1 and hBD3 \\nmay modulate melanocortin receptor signaling \\nin vivo , \\nacting not only on Mc1R but also on Mc5R 24.

HBD3 inhibited α-MSH-induced, but not the for-\\nskolin-induced increase in  cyclic adenosine monopho-\\nsphate (cAMP) levels, thus suggesting that hBD3 acted by \\nblocking the Mc1R\\n25. Moreover, dysregulated expression \\nof hBD3 in the skin may also impair DNA repair re-\\nsponses in UV-induced melanocytes and, consequently, \\nimprove melanoma risk\\n26.\\nParallel to the paracrine influences via keratinocytes, mel-\\nanocyte functionality and skin pigmentation are regulated \\nby the active role of both extracellular matrix (ECM) pro-\\nteins and fibroblasts of the dermal compartment. \\nIn vitro \\nstudies demonstrated the mi togenic and melanogenic in-\\nfluences of ECM proteins such as fibronectin, collagen I \\nand IV on normal human melanocytes and their effect in \\ninhibiting cell vacuolization and death when melanocytes \\nwere growing in mitogen-deficient medium 27. In addition, \\nlaminins and collagen IV are involved in the adhesion of \\nmelanocytes to the basement membrane via integrin inter-\\nactions\\n28. Dermal fibroblasts release many soluble factors \\nable to modulate melanocyte activity: some of these fac-\\ntors are produced also by keratinocytes, such as SCF and \\nHGF, others are specifically synthesized by fibroblasts. \\nMost of these messengers fa vour melanin synthesis and \\nmelanocyte proliferation. Among them, neuregulin-1 is \\nup-regulated in fibroblasts obtained from type VI skin re-\\nspect to those from types I and III and it represents a mela-\\nnogenic factor in the regula tion of the constitutive pig-\\nmentation level of darker skin\\n29. It has been demonstrated \\nthat fibroblasts from palmoplantar skin produce higher \\nlevels of the Wnt pathway an tagonist dickkopf 1 (DKK1) \\nrespect to fibroblasts of the trunk. Differently from the \\ngrowth factors described above, DKK1 exerts an inhibitory \\neffect on melanocyte proliferation and pigment production. \\nMoreover, this soluble factor  acts also on keratinocytes, \\nreducing the expression level of the proteinase-activated \\nreceptor-2, which is involved in melanosome transfer, \\nthus decreasing also this la tter process. These combined \\neffects of DKK1 on both melanocytes and keratinocytes \\ndetermine the physiological  hypopigmentation observed \\nin the epidermis of palms and soles\\n30. The fibroblast \\ngrowth factor family member keratinocyte growth factor/fi-\\nbroblast growth factor 7 (KGF/FGF7) induces melanosome \\ntransfer, promoting the phagot ytic process via activation \\nand signalling of its specific receptor, keratinocyte growth \\nfactor receptor, directly in keratinocytes 31,32. Moreover, \\nthis growth factor stimulates the production and secretion \\nof the promelanogenic mediat or SCF in primary keratino-\\ncytes, creating an indirect paracrine network connecting \\nkeratinocytes and fibroblasts in  the control of melanocyte \\nfunctions\\n33. The important role of KGF in promoting skin \\npigmentation is further demonstrated by additional studies \\nshowing the ability of KGF alone and in association with \\nIL1alpha to increase melanin production and deposition in \\npigmented epidermal equivalents and in human skin ex-\\nplants\\n34. Besides these autocrine and paracrine inter-\\nactions, melanocyte functions are also influenced by hor-\\nmonal factors distally produced, as assessed by the varia-\\ntion of pigmentation observed in the course of endocrine \\nchanges e.g.: (i) hyperpigmentation detected during preg-\\nnancy as a result of increased estrogen levels; (ii) hyper-\\npigmentation of genital area s due to the action of re-\\nproductive hormones\\n35,36.\\nOne basic function of the skin is the prevention of water \\nloss from the body. This may represent the first physio-\\nlogical demand for protection, but  it is equally true that \\nthe skin provides a protective barrier against invading mi-\\ncrobial pathogens, while also serving as a habitat for a ple-\\nthora of commensal bacteria . The stratum corneum pro-\\nvides the first line of defense against pathogenic and envi-\\nronmental assaults and, in fact, the barrier functions of the \\nstratum corneum are interrelated, co-regulated and inter-\\ndependent. The cohe sive structure of the stratum cor-\\nneum, coupled with its low water content and its acidic \\npH, allows the growth of the normal flora, while providing \\na formidable layer of the innate immune system that coun-\\nteracts the invasion of pathogens\\n37. \\nThe recent skin microbiome an alysis of monozygotic and \\ndizygotic Korean twins has allowed to identify and dis-\\ncriminate genetic and environmental effects on the \\nmicrobiome. In particular, the paper reported a strong as-\\nsociation between the composition of skin microbiota and \\nhuman genetic factors related to skin barrier function\\n38. \\nThe stratum corneum is a multilayered tissue composed of \\nflattened and anucleate corneocytes, surrounded by many \\nlamellae sheets, enriched in ceramides, cholesterol, and \\nfree fatty acids. The positioning of these highly hydro-\\nphobic lipids within the extrace llular domains of the stra-\\ntum corneum inhibits the outside movement of water\\n39. \\nHowever, the lamellar bodies secrete not only lipids but \\nalso proteolytic enzymes a nd antimicrobial peptides \\n(AMPs) including corneodesmosin, hBD-2 and the cath-\\nelicidin product, LL-37 by which, after recognizing mi-\\ncrobes via Toll-like receptors or NOD-like receptors, the \\nstratum corneum initiates the defense response. Induction \\nof AMPs can be further increased by cytokines released \\nupon infection and inflammation such as interleukin (IL)-1, \\nIL-17 and IL-22\\n40,41. In addition, UV radiation has been \\nidentified as a potent inducer of AMPs expression in kera-\\ntinocytes, thus explaining the absence of infection despite \\nthe inhibition of adaptive immunity upon UV radiation\\n42. \\nThe hypothesis that epiderma l pigmentation developed in \\nresponse to UV-B induced stre ss to the barrier suggests'),\n",

Accordingly, natural selection would have fa-\\nvored mutations that increase and protect permeability \\nbarrier function and, in fact, pigmented skin displays supe-\\nrior barrier function\\n43. On the other hand, the thicknesses \\nof the stratum corneum is higher in not pigmented skin of \\npatients affected by vitiligo, thus giving to the barrier a \\nphotoprotective role compensating for absent pigmenta-\\ntion\\n44. Moreover, very recently, a dysbiosis in the diversity \\nof microbial community structure in vitiligo lesional skin \\nhas been reported45.\\nA further corroboration that skin pigmentation is in-\\ntricately regulated may be also  supported by the link, re-\\ncently demonstrated, between α-MSH and the perox-\\nisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ in melano-\\ncytes46. Several lines of evidence indicate that cAMP is the \\nmain intracellular messenger responsible for the melano-\\ngenic actions of α-MSH\\n47. Moreover, Mc1R signaling re-\\ncruits c-KIT to activate E RK pathway inde pendently on \\ncAMP in normal human melanocytes and melanoma \\ncells\\n48. α-MSH-induced melanogenesis may also correlate \\nwith the canonical Wnt/ β-catenin pathway activity 49. \\nMore recently it has been demonstrated that α-MSH acti-\\nvates PPAR- γ and such activation depends on the in-\\nduction of the phosphatidylinositol (PI(4,5)P 2/PLCβ) sig-\\nnalling pathway. Therefore, the receptor Mc1R drives mel-\\nanogenesis and proliferation through lipid mediators. In \\nfact, α-MSH treatment failed to reduce cell proliferation \\nrates after PPAR-γ inhibition. In agreement with these data, \\nKang and co-workers\\n50 investigated in a previous study the \\nexpression and function of pe roxisome PPARs, which be-\\nlong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that hetero-\\ndimerize with the retinoic X receptor and initially known \\nfor their important role in fat metabolism and adipocyte \\ndifferentiation, on melanocyte proliferation, differentiation \\nand melanogenesis. Moreover, PPAR- γ induces differ-\\nentiation and increases cell antioxidant defense in re-\\nsponse to natural or pharmacological agonists both in mel-\\nanocytes and melanoma cells\\n51. \\nDEREGULATION OF THE EPIDERMAL-DERMAL \\nINTERPLAY IN PIGMENTARY DISORDERS: \\nPATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS \\nIncreased production of one or more of pro-melanogenic \\nfactors often associated to an altered expression of their re-\\nceptors have been detected in several hyperpigmentary \\ndisorders. Solar/senile lentigines (SLs) are hyperpigmented \\nlesions mainly localized on photodamaged body sites, \\nwhose onset is commonly observed along with aging. The \\nunderlying mechanisms responsible for the occurence and \\nmaintainance of these spots are not yet completely \\ndefined. Molecules related to inflammatory and fatty acid \\nmetabolism are induced in SL, probably linked to chron-\\nical UV exposure. Deregulation in the expression of sev-\\neral pro-melanogenic factors has been demonstrated, in-\\nvolving both keratinocyte- and fibroblast-derived network. \\nIn lesional epidermis, ET-1 and its receptor ET-B, SCF and \\nits receptor c-Kit signalling cascades are up-modulated, as \\nwell as the expression of α-MSH and Mc1R\\n52. p53 has \\nbeen shown to play an important role in the onset of these \\nspots through its ability to induce the pro-pigmenting cyto-\\nkines ET-1, SCF and POMC. In SL lesions, the expression \\nof KGF and its receptor appears to be increased at ear-\\nly-mid stages, suggesting the involvement of this growth \\nfactor in the onset of the pigmented spots. Moreover, the \\ntreatment with KGF and KGF as sociated with IL-1alpha, \\ninduces hyperpigmented lesions \\nin vivo34,53. In SL the in-\\nduction of pro-melanogenic gr owth factors signalling cas-\\ncades has been highlighted also in the dermis, with high \\nexpression of KGF, SCF and HG F in lesional fibroblasts. \\nThe crucial contribution of the dermis and, specifically, of \\nphotoaged fibroblasts in the formation of SL hyper-\\npigmentation are now increasingly strengthened by a \\nnumber of \\nin vitro models reported in the literature: (i) a \\nhigher expression of KGF, SCF and HGF using a model of \\nstress-induced premature sene scence in fibroblasts has \\nbeen reported33; (ii) Salducci et al. 54 showed the ability of \\nconditioned medium produced by UV-exposed aged fi-\\nbroblasts to induce the main SL features in pigmented re-\\nconstructed epidermis; (iii) Duval et al.\\n55 demonstrated an \\nincreased epidermal pigmentation in a reconstructed skin \\nmodel containing natural photo-aged fibroblasts. Very \\nrecently, an increased expression of KGF in SL has been \\nreported also in the epidermal compartment, supporting \\nthe hypothesis that the transfer and accumulation of this fi-\\nbroblast-derived growth fact or into the epidermis may \\nlead to the persistence of hyperpigmentation\\n56. In the pro-\\ngression of this altered dermal-epidermal interplay, it has \\nbeen suggested that an incr eased diffusion of heparin- \\nbinding growth factors such as FGFs, HGF, GM-CSF from \\ndermis to epidermis and vice  versa may be favoured by \\nthe reported heparanase-induced  degradation of heparan \\nsulfate at the base ment membrane observed in solar lenti-\\ngo\\n57.

In addition, the basement \\nmembrane in lesional skin appears distrupted and dis-\\norganized, with the presence of the so called pendulous \\nmelanocytes. The expression of  the metalloproteinase 2 is \\nalso increased due to the ch ronic UV exposure and such \\nup-modulation is possibly resp onsible for the dysfunction \\nof the basement membrane. These changes may, in turn, \\nexcessively activate the dermal-epidermal interactions, fur-\\nther underscoring the crucial role of the signalling net-\\nwork among melanocytes and ot her skin cell populations \\nin the formation of melasma lesions\\n60,61. An increased \\nnumber of blood vessels associated with an up-modu-\\nlation of the vascular endothe lial growth factor have been \\nalso detected, highlighting the presence of an altered vas-\\ncularization in melasma lesions\\n62. Lastly, likewise solar \\nlentigo, accumulation of the melanogenic factor KGF in \\nthe lesional epidermis has been observed56. Very recently, \\nan up-regulation of the secret ed frizzled-ralated protein 2 \\n(sFRP2) in the skin of melasma, solar lentigo and acutely \\nUV-irradiated skin has been shown. This over-expression \\nleads to increased melanogenesis through the activation of \\nthe β-catenin signalling and t hus up-regulation of MITF \\nand tyrosinase in melanocytes. Interestingly, a strong ex-\\npression of sFRP2 was detected in lesional fibroblasts, fur-\\nther demonstrating the crucial role of the epithelial-mesen-\\nchymal interplay in the control of physiological and \\npathological skin pigmentation\\n63. One more, an un-\\nbalance of fibroblast-derived growth factors able to stim-\\nulate melanocyte and induce pigmentation has been ob-\\nserved in other pigmentary disorders: (i) in the benign fi-\\nbroblastic tumor dermatofibroma, the hyperpigmentation \\noften observed in the above epidermis, has been attrib-\\nuted to the increased secreti on of SCF and HGF by the fi-\\nbroblastic tumour cells\\n64; (ii) similarly, an heightened re-\\nlease of the same two growth factors by fibroblasts has \\nbeen suggested to be involv ed in the epidermal hyper-\\npigmentation of café-au lait macules of neurofibromatosis \\ntype 1 (NF1) patients65; (iii) An increased expression of the \\nfibroblast-derived growth factors SCF, HGF and KGF in \\nthe dermis of two patients with a generalized, progressive \\ndyschromatosis disorder 66. Likewise, the hyper-\\npigmentation sometimes observed in both basal cell carci-\\nnoma (BCC) and seborrhoeic keratosis (SK) has been \\nlinked to an accentuated expression of the keratino-\\ncyte-derived ET-1 67,68 (Fig. 2). Taken together, all these \\nstudies show how intricate is the interplay among dermal \\nand epidermal cells with me lanocytes and how the varia-\\ntion of one or more of these interactions can result in a va-\\nriety of different hyperpigme nted lesions. On the other \\nhand, changes in the synthesis and release of these mes-\\nsengers has been observed in hypopigmented disorders \\nsuch as vitiligo. Despite significant studies contributed to a \\ngreater knowledge of vitiligo, understanding its patho-\\ngenesis is still a challenge. Vitiligo is characterized by the \\ndisappearance of functional melanocytes, and multiple \\nmechanisms might contribute to this loss, including genet-\\nic defects, metabolic abnormalities, oxidative stress, gen-\\neration of inflammatory mediators, cell detachment and \\nautoimmune responses. Nevertheless, a growing amount \\nof evidence in recent years ar gues for intrinsic metabolic \\ndefects in melanocytes leading to an intracellular oxida-\\ntive stress that may act as the initial signal transduction \\nsustaining cell degeneration\\n69. Such metabolic impairment \\nmay be not restricted to melanocytes but also extended to \\ndermal cells 70. According to the idea that an increase of \\noxidative stress and impaired ability to effectively manage \\nstressful stimuli are some of the hallmarks of vitiligo skin, \\nmelanocytes from non lesional areas show alterations of \\nsome pathways, including hyperactivation of mi-\\ntogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cyclic AMP re-\\nsponse element-binding protein (CREB), and p53 over-ex-\\npression, leading to a condition of stress induced pre-\\nmature senescence-like phenotype which is characterized \\nby the production of IL-6, ma trix metalloproteinase 3, cy-\\nclooxygenase 2, and insulin- like growth factor-binding \\nprotein 3 (IGFBP3) and IGFBP7\\n71. Among the alterations \\nreported in vitiligo skin, changes in the production of ker-\\natinocyte-derived factors have been described by several \\nauthors, showing either an up- or a down-modulation: \\nKitamura et al.\\n72 described an increased expression of \\nET-1 and SCF transcripts associated with an higher SCF \\nprotein expression in lesional versus non-lesional vitiligo \\nepidermis. The authors reported also a selective defi-\\nciency in the expression of SCF receptor c-KIT and MITF at \\nthe edge of the lesion, suggesting that the reduced func-\\ntion of the SCF/c-KIT signalling cascade may contribute to \\nmelanocyte alterations and lo ss. On the other hand, other \\ngroups demonstrated a reduced production of SCF by ker-\\natinocytes of the depigmented epidermis, possibly due to \\na higher vulnerability of these cells to apoptosis. \\nConsequenlty, this reduced secretion of surviving factors \\nmay concur to melanocyte death\\n73,74. In lesional skin, a \\nlower expression of GM-CSF, bFGF and ET-1, associated \\nwith a higher amount of the melanocyte inhibitor cyto-\\nkines IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor- α have been also re-\\nported\\n75 evidencing, altogether, the contribution of kerati-'),\n",

In the dermis, a reduction in the expression \\nof collagen IV and an up-regulation of the ECM protein te-\\nnascin have been de scribed, possibly linked to the de-\\ncreased adhesion of vitiligo melanocytes 77,78.

In the treatment of vitiligo, re-\\npigmentation frequently begins in the peri-follicular area. \\nThis likely arises from the reservoir of melanocyte stem \\ncells (MelSCs) in the hair follicle bulge 81.

Quiescence, \\nmaintenance, activation and proliferation of MelSC are \\nmediated by specific activities in the microenvironment \\nthat can influence the differentiation and regeneration of \\nmelanocytes. In response to wouding or UV irradiation, \\nfollicular MelSC migrate towards the basal layer of the \\nepidermis and differentiate into functional epidermis \\nmelanocytes. This migration behavior of MelSC following \\nenvironmental stimuli gives the opportunity to develop \\ntherapeutic approaches for treating skin hypopigmentation \\ndisorders by manipulating this stem cell population. For is-\\ntance, narrow-band UV-B exposure has been used to treat \\npatient with vitiligo, thus leading to follicular repigmen-\\ntation of depigmented skin. The mechanicistic rationale \\nunderlying the success of this therapy is related to the pro-\\nliferation, migration and differentiation of MelSC\\n83.\\nNevertheless, during vitiligo treatment some areas are re-\\nfractory to repigmentation  such as hands and feet 84. The \\nmost relevant reason seems to be the lower melanocyte \\ndensity, lower melanocyte stem cells reservoirs and lower \\nbaseline levels of epidermal stem cell requiring factors\\n85. \\nThe maturation and function of hair follicle stem cells are \\nregulated by dermal cells, in cluding adipocytes, dermal \\npapilla cells and fibroblasts, and it is plausible that meta-\\nbolic impairment of dermal cells will affect stem cells. \\nMoreover, the Herlyn group demonstrated that when der-\\nmal stem cells are embedded into dermis, a subpopulation \\nmigrates to the epidermis and differentiates into melano-\\ncytes\\n86.\\nMelanocyte stem cells have also been identified in the \\nsweat glands of volar skin and they can contribute to the \\nepidermal melanocyte population87. Furthermore, possible \\nexistence of melanocytes or melanoblasts has been ob-\\nserved in human sebaceous glands88.\\nCONCLUSIONS \\nUnderstanding the developm ent and evolution of pig-\\nmentary system requires the knowledge of cellular inter-\\nactions and signaling pathways producing this system. The \\ncolour of human skin is determined by the amount and \\ntype of melanin pigment pr oduced by melanocytes and \\ntransferred to keratinocytes. Nevertheless, the range of \\nphenotypic differences in pigmentary traits it is not only \\nattributed to melanocyte cells but it certainly encompasses \\nother skin cell populations.

Vitiligo is associated with few autoimmune disorders; thyroid disorders \\nbeing mostly prominent2. The etiology and pathogenic mechanisms of vitiligo are \\nstill poorly understood which has hindered the progress in diagnosis and treatment3. \\nVitiligo is classified into 3 subtypes based on distribution: generalized, segmental, \\nand localized2. Generalized vitiligo (also referred to as non-segmental vitiligo), which \\nis the most common form of vitiligo, involves loss of pigment (depigmentation) in \\npatches of skin all over the body. Segmental vitiligo is an uncommon form of \\nlocalized vitiligo, characterized by dermatomal distribution. It is often unilateral, \\nasymmetrical and never crosses the midline of body. Localized vitiligo is \\ncharacterized by the development of a few patches that appear in one or few areas \\nof the body. The degree of severity of the disease depends on the body surface \\naffected. \\nVitiligo can be manifested as distinct clinical variants: trichrome (lesions that have a \\ntan zone of varying width between normal and totally depigmented skin, which \\nexhibits an intermediate hue4), marginal inflammatory (a unique subset of vitiligo \\nvulgaris presenting with scattered depigmented, pruritic patches surrounded by a \\nraised, erythematous border5), quadrichrome (additional presence of marginal or \\nperifollicular hyperpigmentation; recognized more frequently in darker skin types, \\nparticularly in areas of repigmentation), and pentachrome (additional blue-gray \\nhyperpigmented macules, representing areas of melanin incontinence). Less \\ncommon variants include the confetti type or vitiligo ponctue. (Several tiny, discrete \\nhypomelanotic macules6). Finally, the Koebner Phenomenon is described as vitiligo \\nfollowing an injury to the skin, such as a scratch, scrape, or burn7. Initial lesions occur \\nmost frequently on the hands, forearms, feet, and face, favoring a periocular or \\nperioral distribution2. Other patterns include lip-tip vitiligo (affecting mostly the lips \\nand fingertips), acrofacial vitiligo (involves the lips or other parts of the face plus the \\nhands and/or feet), and focal vitiligo (affects only a small area of the body)7. Finally, \\nuniversal vitiligo involves most of the body7.'),\n",

Patterns of Vitiligo. Retrieved from https://www.umassmed.edu/vitiligo/blog/blog-\\nposts1/2020/05/patterns-of-vitiligo/  \\nUnderreporting of vitiligo across all skin types may be a concern, as some healthcare \\nproviders may perceive it as a cosmetic issue rather than recognizing it as a well-\\ndefined autoimmune disease8. \\nThe global prevalence of vitiligo is estimated to range from 0.5% to 2% of the \\npopulation; the prevalence reported by most studies is 0.6%. However, it is important \\nto bear in mind that Vitiligo prevalence rates vary geographically. For instance, \\nhigher prevalence rates are recorded in Africa and India8. In Saudi Arabia, as of 2020, \\nthe prevalence of Vitiligo was reported at 3.12%9. Vitiligo is found to affect both males \\nand females at similar rates and is not limited to specific racial, ethnic, or \\nsocioeconomic groups. While it can manifest at any age, it is most commonly \\nobserved during the second and third decades of life. Approximately one-third of \\nindividuals with vitiligo develop the condition during childhood, while a significant \\nmajority, around 70% to 80%, experience its onset before reaching the age of 30 \\nyears10. \\nVitiligo manifests clinically as white patches on the skin, appearing in a symmetrical \\npattern. These patches are especially prominent in individuals with darker skin \\ntones. The affected areas are distinguishable by clearly defined, pearly white or \\ndepigmented spots and irregularly shaped macules and patches, which can be oval, \\nround, or linear in form. Their edges are raised, varying in size from a few millimeters \\nto centimeters, and they expand outward from the center. Depigmentation may \\nlead to psychological distress, social stigmatization, and low self-esteem2.'),\n",

Furthermore, European guidelines emphasize \\ndiagnosis, classification, therapy, and supportive care for vitiligo. International \\nguidelines elaborated on treatment of vitiligo aimed at children, pregnant patients, \\nnursing mothers and the elderly. \\nMain recommendations issued by different Health Technology Assessment (HTA) \\nbodies on the use of the current medications in Vitiligo were reviewed and \\nsummarized under each drug therapy table in Section 2.0. These include the \\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Canadian Agency for \\nDrugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), the \\nInstitute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWIG), and the Pharmaceutical \\nBenefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).  \\nThe management of vitiligo involves a multidisciplinary approach. Various methods \\nare employed for treating vitiligo, encompassing a range of topical and systemic \\nmedications, phototherapy, laser therapy, and surgical interventions. Topical \\ntreatments consist of corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and vitamin-D analogs. \\nPhototherapy, specifically narrowband UV-B with a 311-312nm wavelength, is a highly \\neffective treatment, promoting repigmentation in early and localized cases. Surgical \\ntreatments are reserved for segmental or localized vitiligo affecting small areas. \\nNewly emerging methods for the management of vitiligo include the \\npharmacological management with topical ruxolitinib and the use of RECELL® \\nmedical device for restoration of pigmentation; both of which were FDA approved in \\n2022 and 2023 respectively; however, neither is SFDA registered. \\nSection 2.0 provides a full description of each pharmacological agent with final \\nstatements on the placement of therapy. All recommendations are well supported \\nby reference guidelines, Grade of Recommendation (GoR), Level of Evidence (LoE) \\nand Strength of Agreement (SoA) reflecting specific drug class role in the \\nmanagement of Vitiligo.'),\n",

It was published in two parts: the first covered the epidemiology, \\nquality of life, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, associations, histopathology, etiology, \\nand work-up17, and the second detailed the treatment options and approach to \\ntreatment13. For brevity purposes, only part II will be included in this report. The main \\nrecommendations issued are detailed below13:  \\n• There are various treatment options for vitiligo: these include but are not \\nlimited to non-surgical, surgical, and alternative options. \\n• Nonsurgical options include pharmacological approaches (using topical or \\nsystemic therapy), phototherapy, photochemotherapy, and laser therapy. \\n• Surgical options include melanocyte cell suspension transplantation and skin \\ngrafting. \\n• Other suggested approaches include camouflage products, psychotherapy, \\nand depigmentation therapy. \\n• The treatment efficacy is based on several factors such as the type of vitiligo \\nthat the patient is subjected to, the duration and distribution of the disease \\nand the use of combination regimens in the treatment process.  \\nIndividual Prognostic Factors:  \\n• In patients who are left untreated, disease progression is attributed to \\nmucosal involvement, a family history of vitiligo, the Koebner Phenomenon, \\nand the presence of non-segmental vitiligo. \\n• Patients with the following characteristics are more likely to respond to \\ntherapy: younger patients, those with recent onset of disease, darker skin \\ntypes, and lesions of the face, neck, and trunk.'),\n",

Pharmacological Therapy \\na. Corticosteroids \\n• The first line therapy for vitiligo is topical corticosteroid (CS) therapy; these \\nagents may be used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy.  \\n• Systemic corticosteroids play an important role in stopping disease \\nprogression and inducing repigmentation; however, limitations to their use \\ninclude their side effect profile.  \\n• If patients are treated with corticosteroids, frequent monitoring and regular \\nsteroid holidays are recommended to limit and potentially prevent side \\neffects.  \\n• Higher response rates are seen in children compared to adults with head and \\nneck lesions having the greatest response to treatment. \\n• Regardless of route, CS combination with light therapy yields a favorable \\noutcome. \\nb. Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors \\n• The off-label use of topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) has been shown to be \\nsafe and effective in the treatment of vitiligo for both adults and children. \\n• TCIs are also known to enhance the effect of light/laser therapy. \\n• Given the lack of local side effects and efficacy comparable to topical CSs, TCIs \\nare appropriate for intermittent long-term use and for those who cannot \\ntolerate topical CSs.  \\n• Face and neck lesions respond best, and occlusion may help with recalcitrant \\nlesions on the extremities. \\n• Concerns regarding potential systemic absorption may be alleviated by \\nlimiting the application of TCIs to a small body surface area, such as the face.  \\nc. Vitamin D3 Analogs \\n• Calcipotriene is a topical vitamin D3 analog with an antiproliferative effect on \\nkeratinocytes, an immunomodulatory effect, and an ability to enhance \\nmelanocyte development and melanogenesis.  \\n• Topical vitamin D3 analogs are mostly beneficial when combined with topical \\nCS; repigmentation rates increase, the delay in the onset of repigmentation \\nshortens, and there is a greater stability of repigmentation compared with \\neither, as monotherapy. The combination therapy is effective in some \\npreviously steroid nonresponsive patients.'),\n",

Phototherapy \\n• Phototherapy is ideally reserved for patients who fail topical therapy or for \\nthose with lesions of large surface areas. \\n• Narrowband UVB phototherapy is superior to PUVA phototherapy – \\nspecifically, 311nm NBUVB; however, PUVA yields quicker results. \\n• UVA phototherapy is almost always given in conjunction with Psoralen (A \\nphotosensitizer); however, the combination increases the risk of melanoma \\nand nonmelanoma skin cancers.  \\n3. Laser Therapy \\n• The Monochromatic Excimer Laser or MEL (308nm) is the most used laser \\ntherapy for the treatment of Vitiligo. \\n• As per Casacci et al18, MEL has proven to lead to better clinical outcomes \\ncompared to NBUVB phototherapy. \\n• In most clinical trials, the MEL is used one to three times a week for an initial \\ncourse of 12 weeks; 11 to 22 sessions are required on average to see \\nrepigmentation, more in poorly responsive acral areas. \\n• Bioskin, a device regarded as microphototherapy, transmits focused 311nm \\nUVB phototherapy; all other tested modalities resulted in enhanced \\nrepigmentation rates when used in combination with Bioskin compared to \\nuse as monotherapy.  \\n• For patients with segmental vitiligo who have poorer responses to \\nconventional treatment compared to non-segmental vitiligo, the 632.8-nm \\nhelium neon (HeNe) laser is recommended; whereby, repigmentation begins \\nfollowing 16 to 17 treatments; however, this is not a standard therapy regimen. \\n4. Photochemotherapy \\n• The furocoumarin psoralens 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), 5-methoxypsoralen \\n(5-MOP), and trimethylpsoralen (TMP) have been successfully used for the \\nmanagement of vitiligo when given in combination with UVA therapy. \\n• The use of topical 8-MOP is limited to patients with small lesions (< 5% body \\nsurface area), or who are younger than 12 years of age in whom systemic \\nPsoralen/Ultraviolet A Radiation (PUVA) phototherapy is contraindicated.'),\n",

Then, a marginally higher strength \\nof topical psoralen preparation is prescribed, and the same time intervals are \\nfollowed.  \\nThis procedure is repeated until a dosage and exposure time are attained that \\nproduce erythema but not burning.  \\nThe patients need to wash off the remaining 8-MOP with soap and water \\nimmediately after the irradiation and apply UVA sunblock to avoid additional \\nenvironmental UVA exposure. \\n• It is suggested that another agent, Khellin, is administered topically or orally \\nand is said to have vasodilatory effects.  \\nStudies suggest that Khellin exhibits a stimulatory effect on melanogenesis \\nand melanocyte proliferation when combined with UVA light.  \\nCompared directly to PUVA, Khellin/Ultraviolet A Radiation (KUVA) \\nphototherapy required higher doses and a longer duration of treatment to \\nachieve the same response, but patients experienced fewer side effects than \\nwith PUVA phototherapy. \\n• L-Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid used in the initiation of \\nmelanogenesis in melanocytes. It can be applied topically or taken orally. \\nTreatment of vitiligo with L-Phe can be used for any patient with access to \\nnatural or UVA light.  \\nThe patient population who responds best is that with less than 25% body \\nsurface area affected, a disease onset before 21 years of age, and with \\ngeneralized, symmetrical lesions. \\n5. Antioxidants \\n• Topical and oral antioxidants may have a role in protecting melanocytes from \\ndestruction by reactive oxygen species.

Surgical Therapies \\n• Surgical treatment should be reserved for patients with stable vitiligo \\nrefractory to non-surgical therapy. \\n• Surgical procedures include blister graft, split-thickness skin graft, punch graft \\nand autologous melanocyte suspension transplant. \\n• The blister graft and punch graft are more favorable since they do not require \\ngeneral anesthesia and leave the patient unscathed.  \\n• The split-thickness skin graft can be useful to cover large areas but yields less \\ndesirable cosmetic outcomes at the donor site.  \\n• For patients with focal or segmental vitiligo, Autologous Melanocyte \\nSuspension Transplant is an appropriate alternative to tissue grafting. \\n7. Depigmentation \\n• Depigmentation is the treatment of choice for patients who fail \\nrepigmentation therapy or have extensive disease.  \\n• Topical agents that depigment normal skin include monobenzone (also called \\nmonobenzyl ether of hydroquinone, or MBEH) which induces melanocyte \\ndeath.  \\n• Depigmenting agents and laser therapy only provide temporary cosmetic \\nrelief.  \\n8.

It tells you \\nwhat it is, what causes it, what can be done \\nabout it and where you can find out more \\nabout it.  \\nWHAT IS ACNE? \\nAcne is a very common skin condition. It is \\nidentified by the presence of blackheads and \\nwhiteheads (comedones) and pus-filled spots \\n(pustules). Acne ranges from a few spots on \\nthe face, neck, back and chest, to a more \\nsevere problem with solid painful lumps \\nunder the skin. It may cause scarring. Acne \\nusually starts during puberty. Occasionally, \\nyoung children develop blackheads and/or \\npustules on the cheeks or nose. \\nMost people will experience some form of \\nacne during their lifetime. In most cases, acne \\ngoes away by the early to mid-twenties. In \\nother cases, it can go on for longer. Acne can \\nalso develop for the first time in people in \\ntheir late twenties and beyond. \\nWHAT CAUSES ACNE? \\nAcne is caused by a combination of factors.  \\n• Sebaceous (oil-producing) glands are \\ntiny glands found near the surface of \\nthe skin and are affected by our \\nhormones. In acne, the glands are \\nparticularly sensitive, even when these \\nhormones are at normal levels. This \\ncauses the glands to produce too \\nmuch oil (sebum).  \\n• At the same time, the lining of the \\npores (the small holes in the skin’s \\nsurface) becomes thickened and dead \\nskin cells build up and block the pores. \\n \\n• The mixture of the oil and dead skin \\ncells plugging the pores produces \\nblackheads and whiteheads.  \\n• Harmless bacteria that live on \\neveryone’s skin usually cause no \\nproblems. However, in acne, the build-\\nup of oil creates an ideal environment \\nfor the bacteria to multiply and cause \\ninflammation. This leads to the \\nformation of red, swollen or pus-filled \\nspots. (papules, pustules, nodules or \\ncysts).  \\n• Sometimes acne can be caused or \\nmade worse by excess hormones. This \\nmay occur in women in a condition \\ncalled polycystic ovary syndrome \\n(PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal imbalance \\nthat causes irregular periods, unusual \\nhair growth and hair thinning.  \\n• Acne can also be due to certain \\nhormonal contraceptive preparations \\nor high-dose steroids. Some tablets \\ntaken by bodybuilders contain \\nhormones (anabolic steroids) that can \\ntrigger acne. \\n• Occasionally, other types of \\nmedications can make acne worse. If \\nyou develop acne or it suddenly gets \\nworse, it would be worth discussing \\nthis with your healthcare professional. \\n• Oily skin care products, greasy \\nmoisturisers and hair products, or \\ncontact with oily substances at work, \\ncan also cause or worsen acne. Skin \\npicking can also make acne worse and \\ncause scarring. \\nThere is not enough evidence to support \\nspecific diets for treating acne. However, a \\nhealthy, well-balanced diet is advisable. For \\nfurther information, see'),\n",

It is likely that a combination of \\ngenetic, hormonal and lifestyle factors (such \\nas stress, skincare products, smoking, etc.) act \\nin combination to cause most acne. \\nWHAT DOES ACNE LOOK LIKE AND WHAT \\nDOES IT FEEL LIKE? \\nAcne is a mixture of the following: oily skin, \\nblackheads, whiteheads, red spots and pus-\\nfilled pimples. Occasionally, larger, deeper \\nbumps (known as nodules) or cysts (which \\nresemble boils) may develop. Affected skin \\nmay feel hot, painful and be tender to touch.  \\nAcne can leave scars or marks on the skin, \\nparticularly in the presence of nodules and \\ncysts. These may be raised and lumpy (known \\nas hypertrophic or keloid scars) or indented \\n(known as pitted or atrophic scars). Acne can \\nalso leave discolouration which may be red, \\nhyperpigmented (darker than your usual skin \\ncolour) or hypopigmented (lighter than your \\nnormal skin colour).  \\nNot all spots are acne, so if there is \\nsomething unusual about the rash it is \\nadvisable to consult your healthcare \\nprofessional. \\nOne important aspect of being affected by \\nacne that is not discussed often is its impact \\non mental health. Acne can significantly affect \\nan individual’s psychological well-being. This \\nmay lead to low self-esteem, lack of \\nconfidence, negative body image \\n(appearance-related concerns), anxiety and \\ndepression. Severe acne has been associated \\nwith suicidal behaviour. It is important to \\nrecognise the impact acne may have on how \\nyou feel. If required, speak with your \\nhealthcare professional about available \\nsupport.  \\nHOW IS ACNE DIAGNOSED? \\nA healthcare professional can diagnose acne \\nduring a skin examination. They do not \\nusually need to run any diagnostic tests as it \\nis easily recognised by the type of spots and \\nby their distribution on the face, neck, chest \\nor back.  \\nCAN ACNE BE CURED? \\nAt present, there is no ‘cure’ for acne. \\nTreatments can be very effective, preventing \\nthe formation of new spots and reducing \\nscarring. \\nHOW CAN ACNE BE TREATED? \\nThe first step is to use skincare products \\nsuitable for blemish-prone skin. These may \\nbe labelled as ‘non-comedogenic’ or ‘oil-free’.  \\nActive topical treatments (those applied \\ndirectly to the skin) can be bought over the \\ncounter without a prescription. These include \\nbenzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid and \\nnicotinamide. You should speak to your \\npharmacist for advice about these. Most \\ntreatments take 2 to 4 months to produce \\ntheir full effect. \\nIf you have acne but have had no success \\nwith over-the-counter products, then it is \\nadvisable to visit your healthcare \\nprofessional.  \\nAcne treatments fall into the following \\ncategories: \\n• Topical treatments, i.e. those that are \\napplied directly to the skin  \\n• Oral antibiotics, i.e. tablets taken by \\nmouth \\n• Oral contraceptive pills  \\n• Isotretinoin capsules \\n• Spironolactone tablets  \\n• Other treatments  \\nTopical treatments \\nThese are usually the first choice for those \\nwith mild to moderate acne. There is a variety \\nof active anti-acne agents. These include \\nbenzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics (e.g. \\nerythromycin, tetracycline and clindamycin), \\ntopical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin, isotretinoin \\nand adapalene), azelaic acid and nicotinamide \\n(also known as niacinamide). They should be \\napplied to the areas of your skin that are \\naffected by acne and not just to individual'),\n",

Usually, this is done every night or \\ntwice daily, depending on the treatment.  \\nSome topical treatments can be irritating to \\nthe skin. It may be advised that the treatment \\nis tested on a small area of affected skin for a \\nfew applications before being applied to the \\nentire affected area. It may also be \\nrecommended that you gradually increase \\nhow often you use the treatment, for \\nexample using it once or twice weekly. This \\ncould lead to regular daily use, if it is \\ntolerated. Consult your healthcare \\nprofessional if the treatment continues to \\ncause irritation of the skin despite reducing \\nthe number of times it is applied. \\nSome topical treatments, such as retinoids \\ncan lead to the acne getting worse for a few \\nweeks before it gets better. \\nOral antibiotic treatment  \\nYour healthcare professional may \\nrecommend a course of antibiotic tablets, \\nusually erythromycin or a type of tetracycline. \\nWhenever possible, these should be taken at \\nthe same time as using topical treatments. It \\ncould improve your acne and help prevent \\nyour body getting used to the antibiotics. \\nAntibiotics need to be taken for at least 12 \\nweeks and are usually continued until there is \\nno further improvement. A course of \\nantibiotics is usually given for 3 to 6 months. \\nThey should not normally be continued for \\nmore than 6 months due to concerns about \\nantibiotic resistance. Some antibiotics should \\nnot be taken with food or can make your skin \\nmore sensitive to the sun, so read the \\ninstructions carefully. It is also essential to let \\nyour doctor know if you are planning a \\npregnancy as some antibiotics cannot be \\ntaken if you are pregnant. \\nOral contraceptive treatments \\nOral combined contraceptive pills containing \\ncyproterone acetate may be helpful in \\nwomen with hormone imbalances, who are \\naffected by acne. These are usually used for \\npeople with PCOS. These tablets carry a small \\nrisk of blood clots so you must tell your \\ndoctor if you have any past history of these. \\nThis is a greater risk for people who smoke, \\nare overweight or have others in the family \\nwho have had blood clots. \\nIsotretinoin \\nIsotretinoin is a highly effective treatment for \\nsevere acne. The improvements can be long-\\nlasting in those who complete a course of \\ntreatment. However, it has the potential to \\ncause some serious side effects. Isotretinoin \\ncan be prescribed only under the supervision \\nof a dermatology healthcare professional. \\nMost courses of isotretinoin last for around 6 \\nmonths. During this time, the skin usually \\nbecomes dry, particularly around the lips. \\nRegular application of a lip balm can be \\nhelpful. Often, acne becomes a little worse for \\na few weeks before improvement occurs. The \\nimprovement is progressive throughout the \\ncourse of treatment, so do not be \\ndisappointed if progress seems slow. \\nIsotretinoin can harm an unborn child. The \\ngovernment’s medicine safety agency (MHRA) \\nhas strict rules for prescribing this medicine. \\nPeople who are able to get pregnant must \\nenrol in a pregnancy prevention programme \\n(PPP). They need to have a negative \\npregnancy test before starting treatment. It is \\nvery important to use reliable contraception \\nwhilst taking isotretinoin.  \\nUsually, pregnancy tests will be repeated \\nevery month during treatment. This is \\nrequired if you are using a contraceptive pill \\n(or contraceptive injection) plus a barrier \\nmethod of contraception. Another pregnancy \\ntest is also required 1 month after completing \\nthe course of treatment.  \\nPregnancy tests may be done less frequently \\nif you are using a highly effective, ‘user \\nindependent’ method of contraception. These \\ninclude contraceptive implants, coils (IUD) or \\nintra-uterine systems (IUS). ‘User \\nindependent’ means that you do not have to \\nremember to take the contraception.  \\nContraception must be used for at least 4 \\nweeks before treatment, during treatment, \\nand for at least four weeks after. \\nFollowing a report by the Commission on \\nHuman Medicines’ Isotretinoin Expert \\nWorking Group in April 2023, concerns were'),\n",

We know that people affected by \\nacne are more likely to experience anxiety \\nand depression than people who are not \\naffected. This is because acne may affect self-\\nconfidence and make people distressed \\nabout the way they look. \\nSeveral studies have shown that isotretinoin \\ncan improve negative mood changes caused \\nby acne. \\nYou should tell your healthcare professional if \\nyou have any personal or family history of low \\nmood, depression or other mental health \\ncondition when considering isotretinoin \\ntherapy. You may be asked to see a mental \\nhealthcare professional before any treatment \\nis commenced, to determine if it is safe for \\nyou to proceed. Letting close friends and \\nfamily know about your treatment provides \\nan opportunity for them to notice any \\nchanges in your mood. If this is the case, you \\nshould report these to your doctor without \\ndelay. \\nThere are very rare reports of people having \\nsexual function problems with isotretinoin. \\nWe do not know how often these may occur. \\nWe know that problems with sexual function \\ncan be related to mental health issues. Other \\nmedication (such as antidepressants), which \\nmay be taken at the same time as \\nisotretinoin, may also cause these. \\nThere are some individual reports of patients \\nexperiencing a lack of interest in sex (low \\nlibido), vaginal dryness, difficulty \\ngetting/keeping an erection and reduced \\nsensation in the genitals. \\nRarely, men have reported breast tissue \\ndevelopment (gynaecomastia). \\nSome people have reported that the \\nproblems have continued after stopping \\ntreatment. \\nIf you have problems with sexual function, \\ndiscuss with your dermatology healthcare \\nprofessional before taking isotretinoin. \\nFurther information about isotretinoin can be \\nfound in the section \"Where can I find more \\ninformation about acne?\". \\nSpironolactone \\nSpironolactone is a drug usually prescribed \\nfor heart problems, high blood pressure and \\nfluid retention. It also has hormonal effects by \\nblocking the action of androgens (male \\nhormones), that are normally produced in low \\nlevels by all women. Women affected by acne \\noften have raised levels of androgens or \\nincreased sensitivity to normal levels of \\nandrogens. Some of these women will have \\nPCOS. \\nFor this reason, spironolactone is used “off-\\nlicence” to treat acne in women. An \\nunlicensed drug is one that has not been \\nawarded a Market Authorisation by the UK \\nMedicines Healthcare Products Regulatory \\nAgency (MHRA). Drug licences are awarded \\nfollowing a rigorous process of evaluation by \\nthe MHRA following an application by a \\npharmaceutical company. Once awarded, the \\nlicensed drug can then be marketed and sold \\nin the UK. In the absence of a licence, the \\ndrug may still be prescribed in the UK, \\nprovided there is funding available locally to \\npay for it. Additionally, there must be a clear \\nbody of evidence to confirm that the drug is \\neffective for the condition in question and \\nthat safety concerns have been adequately \\naddressed. \\nTherefore, the off-licence use of \\nspironolactone means that the treatment has \\nnot been authorised to specifically treat acne \\nin the UK by the MHRA. However, there is \\nevidence that it is effective and safe to treat \\nacne. Healthcare professionals can therefore \\nprescribe it when they think that it is \\nnecessary. \\nOther treatments \\nThere are many forms of light and laser \\ntherapy for inflammatory acne. These types of \\ntreatment have given mixed results when \\nstudied and are usually ineffective in the \\ntreatment of severe acne. Laser resurfacing'),\n",

This includes \\nfriends, family members and support \\ngroups. You may also be able to \\naccess a counsellor through school, \\nuniversity or work.  \\n• Let your healthcare professional know \\nif being affected by acne is making you \\nhave low moods, feel depressed or \\nanxious. They will be able to speak \\nwith you about how you are feeling \\nand help you to form a treatment plan. \\nThis may involve help from other \\nspecialists, such as psychologists or \\npsychiatrists, if necessary.  \\n• However, you are affected by acne, it is \\nimportant to take action to control it \\nas soon as it appears. This helps to \\navoid permanent scarring. If acne is \\nmild, it is worth trying over-the-counter \\npreparations in the first instance. \\nIngredients such as salicylic acid or \\nbenzoyl peroxide can be helpful. A \\npharmacist will be able to advise you. \\n• Expect to use your treatments for at \\nleast 12 weeks before you see much \\nimprovement. Make sure that you \\nunderstand how to use them correctly, \\nso you get the maximum benefit.  \\n• Some topical treatments may dry or \\nirritate the skin when you start using \\nthem. If your face goes red and is \\nirritated by a lotion or cream, stop \\ntreatment for a few days. Try using the \\ntreatment less often and then building \\nup gradually. \\n• Make-up may help your confidence. \\nChoose products that are labelled \\n‘non-comedogenic’ (should not cause \\nblackheads or whiteheads) or non-\\nacnegenic (should not cause acne).  \\n• Cleanse your skin and remove make-\\nup with a gentle cleanser and water, or \\nan oil-free soap substitute. Scrubbing \\ntoo hard can irritate the skin and make \\nacne worse. Remember blackheads \\nare not due to poor washing. \\nWHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION \\nABOUT ACNE? \\nWeb links to other relevant sources: \\nAcne Support provides expert, impartial \\ninformation from consultant dermatologists \\non the treatment, causes and prevention of \\nacne, as well as advice on how to access \\nemotional support. \\nhttp://www.acnesupport.org.uk/ \\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acne/ \\nhttp://www.pcds.org.uk/clinical-\\nguidance/acne-vulgaris \\nhttp://www.dermnetnz.org/acne/index.html \\nhttp://www.skincarephysicians.com/acnenet  \\nFurther information on isotretinoin: \\nhttps://www.bad.org.uk/pils/isotretinoin/ \\nhttps://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-\\nhealth/mental-illnesses-and-mental-health-\\nproblems/isotretinoin-and-mental-health'),\n",

It is a disorder of the \\npilosebaceous unit (hair follicle and associated oil gland).  Factors that contribute to acne \\nformation include increased sebum (a substance made up of oil and wax that functions to \\nprotect the skin), increased build-up of material in the hair follicle, increased levels of \\nCutibacterium acnes (a bacteria that is commonly present on the skin in low numbers), and \\ninflammation.  Clinically, there are three categories of acne including comedonal \\n(whiteheads and blackheads), inflammatory (red bumps), and nodular (large, painful \\ncysts). \\nHormones signal oil glands in the skin to increase their production of sebum.  A plug of \\nsebum and keratin (a protein that helps maintain the structure of the skin, hair, and nails) \\nforms and blocks the opening of the hair follicle creating whiteheads and blackheads.  The \\nincreased sebum supports increased concentrations of P. acnes.  This leads to further \\nblockage of the hair follicle opening and to increased inflammation.  Ultimately the hair \\nfollicle can rupture, resulting in large, painful nodules.  Insulin also contributes to the \\nformation of acne.  Insulin and insulin-like growth factor act by directly increasing the \\nactivity of the oil gland, as well as by indirectly increasing the levels of other hormones that \\nstimulate the oil gland including insulin-like growth factor and androgens. \\n \\nFigure 1.

In girls and women, information about \\nmenstrual history (specifically regularity, duration, and quantity of bleeding) and signs of \\nhormonal abnormalities (excessive facial hair, insulin resistance) can also be helpful. \\nTREATMENT \\nSKIN CARE \\nThe first step to managing acne is to adhere to gentle skin care practices.  The skin should \\nbe rinsed gently with warm water once or twice a day.  Washcloths or other abrasive \\nmaterials should be avoided, and only gentle, nonsoap-based cleansers should be used.  \\nDetergent-based soaps, toners, and astringents further dry and irritate the skin.  While they \\ndo remove oil and sebum from the surface of the skin, they do not alter sebum production \\nwithin the oil gland.  Ultimately, overly dry skin signals the pilosebaceous units to make \\nmore oil in order to adequately protect the skin.  Moisturizers can help acne, but it is \\nimportant to make sure any moisturizers or cosmetics are not oil based and are labeled \\nnoncomedogenic. \\nThe impulse to pick and squeeze acne lesions is common and can be difficult to overcome.  \\nThese practices can lead to immediate gratification, but ultimately slow down the \\ndisappearance of specific acne lesions.  These practices also result in tissue injury, which \\ncreates more inflammation and potential scarring that is very difficult, if not impossible, to \\nreverse. \\nFOOD & DRINK \\nHealthy dietary choices are important for overall health.  Anti-inflammatory or \\nMediterranean-style dietary approaches have been found to enhance many aspects of \\nhealth—especially in the setting of inflammatory diseases.  Acne is an inflammatory \\ncondition and will likely improve when dietary choices better align with foods that inhibit \\nrather than promote inflammation.[1]  In particular, low glycemic index/low glycemic load \\ndiets have been shown to improve acne in clinical trials.[2]  More information about these \\ndietary approaches can be found in the “Food and Drink,” Whole Health overview. \\nAvoiding or limiting all forms of dairy may be beneficial.  Dairy intake has been linked to \\nincreased risk and severity of acne.  This is likely in part due to stimulating increased levels \\nof insulin-like growth factor.[3]  Limiting the intake of foods high in added hormones (such \\nas meat and dairy) may also be helpful since these foods may alter hormonal balances and \\nmay lead to overstimulation of the oil gland.  \\nThere is also evidence that increasing plants in the diet can help treat acne.  We know that \\nplants are full of prebiotics—compounds that are either indigestible or partially digestible \\nby humans, which can be metabolized by the microbiome in our guts.  Basically, plants help \\nfeed the gut microbiome and help keep it healthy. Maintaining a healthy balance of'),\n",

Ideally, omega-3 fatty acids should come \\nfrom foods such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, and sardines), flaxseeds, and walnuts.  \\nWhen that is not possible, supplements can be helpful.

They can overlap, so it is not always possible to make a definite diagnosis \\nbetween the two.   \\n  \\nWhat causes cellulitis and erysipelas? \\n  \\nBacteria (germs) get through a break in the skin. This break can be very small, such \\nas from a scratch, ins ect bite or injection, or from another skin disease such as \\nathlete’s foot , eczema or a leg ulcer. The body’s immune system tries to stop the \\nbacteria spreading. If this is not successful, an infection will develop. \\n  \\nErysipelas is usually caused by bacter ia called streptococci.

This leaflet has been written to \\nprovide you with an overview of psoriasis. It \\ntells you what psoriasis is, what causes it, \\nwhat can be done about it, and where you \\ncan find out more about it. The two other \\nleaflets (Topical treatments for psoriasis \\nand Treatment of moderate and severe \\npsoriasis) give more details about the \\ndifferent types of treatment. \\nWHAT IS PSORIASIS? \\nPsoriasis is a common, long term skin \\ncondition that comes and goes throughout \\nyour lifetime. It happens due to over-activity \\nof the immune system. \\nPsoriasis is not infectious; therefore, you \\ncannot catch it from someone else. It does \\nnot scar the skin, although sometimes it can \\ncause temporary changes of skin colour. \\nAlthough psoriasis is a long-term condition \\nthere are many effective treatments \\navailable to keep it under good control. \\nPsoriasis affects about 1 in 50 people. It \\nmay occur at any age from puberty \\nonwards, but rarely can affect younger \\nchildren.  \\nPsoriasis affects the skin and may affect the \\nnails. It is also associated with a condition \\ncalled psoriatic arthritis in about 1 in 5 \\npeople. Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory \\ncondition of the joints which can cause pain \\nand sometimes joint damage. The pain can \\nbe quite variable but is typically worse in \\nthe morning and after rest periods. It may \\nbe associated with hot and swollen joints. \\nIndividuals may also report stiffness in the \\nlower back. It is important to identify any \\npossible joint pain early to help alleviate the \\nsymptoms and reduce long-term \\ncomplications associated with joint \\nsymptoms. This should be managed by a \\nrheumatologist who works with your \\ndermatologist and/or your GP. \\nPsoriasis is considered to be one of a \\nnumber of immune-mediated inflammatory \\ndiseases (IMID). Other IMIDs include \\nankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and \\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  \\nPeople affected by psoriasis and other \\nIMIDs may also have a higher risk of \\nexperiencing other health problems. These \\ncan include things like feeling anxious or \\ndepressed, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, \\nobesity, blood clots, high cholesterol, and \\nhigh blood pressure. While we do not fully \\nunderstand why these conditions are \\nconnected, scientists are actively studying \\nthis relationship.  \\nUnderstanding this connection can help \\nindividuals take steps to identify and \\naddress these concerns. It is important to \\nmake informed choices about your lifestyle \\nand consider using health screening \\nservices provided by your doctor (GP). This \\nway, you can take proactive measures to \\nmanage your overall health and well-being. \\nWHAT CAUSES PSORIASIS? \\nThe cause of psoriasis is unknown. It is \\nbelieved that both genetic and \\nenvironmental factors play a role in its \\ndevelopment. It is thought that something \\ntriggers the immune system making it more \\nactive. This then leads to a long-lasting \\n(chronic) inflammation that causes the skin \\ncells to reproduce too quickly.'),\n",

For many people, \\npsoriasis can get better with exposure to \\nUV light (a type of light that comes from the \\nsun and some artificial sources such as \\nsunbeds). However, for others, UV light can \\nworsen psoriasis. Changes in the body, \\nsuch as pregnancy, can make psoriasis \\nbetter, but not always. \\nThe onset and severity of psoriasis has also \\nbeen linked to alcohol consumption, being \\noverweight, smoking, and stress. All of these \\nfactors are known to cause a type of mild \\n(low-grade) inflammation in the body. \\nHowever, not everyone who smokes, drinks \\nalcohol or is overweight will develop \\npsoriasis. \\nWe do not fully understand why these \\ntriggers lead to psoriasis, and it may vary \\nfrom person to person. \\nIS PSORIASIS HEREDITARY? \\nYes, there is a strong family link to psoriasis. \\nIf you have a family member affected by \\npsoriasis, you are more likely to be affected \\nby it too, due to shared genes. The way \\npsoriasis is inherited is complex and not \\ncompletely understood. \\nWHAT DOES PSORIASIS LOOK AND FEEL \\nLIKE? \\n• The skin of a person affected by \\npsoriasis can appear pink, red, or \\ndarker, but in richly pigmented skin, \\nthis may not be visible. The skin also \\nappears scaly – scales are typically of \\nsilvery colour. \\n• The flakes and scales can be visible on \\ndark coloured clothing and may cause \\nanxiety. Many people with psoriasis \\nprefer to avoid dark clothing so that \\nthe flakes  are not obvious. \\n• Psoriasis may affect any part of the \\nbody, but commonly affected areas \\nare the outside surface of the elbow \\nand knee, belly button (umbilicus) and \\nscalp. \\n• Psoriasis can be itchy and painful. \\nCertain sites such as the scalp, lower \\nlegs and groin can be particularly \\nitchy. If psoriasis affects the hands and \\nfeet, painful fissures (cracks) can \\ndevelop, and these can affect use of \\nthe hands and walking. Severe \\npsoriasis on the body can also \\ndevelop cracks which are painful and \\ncan bleed.  \\n• Psoriasis can affect the nails which \\nmay be painful and can cause lifting of \\nthe nail, pitting of the nail or \\ndisfigurement of the nail. These \\nchanges can be painful and may affect \\ndexterity – for example, they can limit \\nthe ability to do simple tasks, such as \\ndoing buttons up or picking small \\nobject up; they also can catch on \\nclothing when getting dressed \\n• When psoriasis affects certain areas of \\nthe body, quality of life may be very \\nsignificantly impacted. These high \\nimpact sites include hands, face, scalp \\ngenitals and feet. \\n• Psoriatic arthritis produces pain, \\nswelling and stiffness in one or more \\njoints, particularly in the morning. It \\ncan also affect connective tissue, \\nligaments and tendons. You must \\nspeak with your doctor if you need a \\nreferral to a rheumatologist. \\n \\nMany people have just a few plaques \\nbut some individuals with moderate to \\nsevere psoriasis may have several \\nplaques covering large areas of their \\nbody.  \\nSeveral patterns of psoriasis are \\nrecognised: \\n• Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most \\ncommon type of psoriasis. Plaques \\n(circular, scaly skin lesions) of psoriasis \\nare usually present on the knees, \\nelbows, trunk, scalp, behind ears and'),\n",

It can be caused \\nby bacteria called streptococcus which \\ncan cause throat infections. \\n• Palmoplantar psoriasis is psoriasis \\naffecting the palms and soles. \\nPsoriasis may appear at other sites \\ntoo. \\n• Pustular psoriasis is rare type of \\npsoriasis where the plaques on the \\ntrunk and limbs are studded with tiny \\nyellow pus filled spots. It can be \\nlocalised or generalised and can flare \\nrapidly necessitating hospital \\nadmission for treatment. \\n• Flexural psoriasis affects the skin folds \\n(armpits and groin) and may be seen \\nalongside chronic plaque psoriasis or \\nin isolation. \\n• Erythrodermic psoriasis is a very \\nsevere form of psoriasis which affects \\nnearly all of the skin and can \\nsometimes require hospital admission \\nfor treatment. \\nNail psoriasis is present in about half of \\npeople with psoriasis. The features of nail \\npsoriasis are: \\n• Pitting (indentations) and ridging of \\nthe surface of the nail \\n• Salmon pink areas of discolouration \\nunder the nail \\n• Lifting of the nails, and \\n• Thickening and yellowing of the nails \\n• Complete nail destruction. \\nHOW WILL PSORIASIS BE DIAGNOSED?  \\nPsoriasis is usually diagnosed on the \\nappearance and distribution of the \\nplaques. Skin biopsy is rarely used. \\nPsoriatic arthritis is usually diagnosed by a \\nrheumatologist, but your dermatologist or \\nGP may ask you if you have any joint \\nsymptoms or ask you to complete a \\nscreening questionnaire. \\nIn most people, skin psoriasis develops first. \\nA small number of people, psoriasis can \\npresent with nail involvement only. Similarly, \\nsome people develop joint symptoms first \\nbefore having skin symptoms. In most \\ncases, it usually takes few years before you \\ndevelop nail or joint symptoms. \\nHOW IS PSORIASIS ASSESSED? \\nPsoriasis should be assessed at diagnosis, \\nbefore your first referral to a specialist, \\nevery time you see a specialist and to \\nassess your response to treatment. \\nPsoriasis may be assessed by your doctors \\nusing a variety of scores which measure the \\nseverity in your skin and joints, how \\npsoriasis is affecting your mood and your \\nactivities of daily living and whether you are \\nat risk of heart disease.  \\nThese scores include the PASI (Psoriasis \\nArea and Severity Index) and DLQI \\n(Dermatology Life Quality Index – a score \\nthat measures the impact of psoriasis on \\nyour quality of life). This assessment will be \\npart of your specialist reviews and it will \\nhelp monitor the effects of treatment on \\nfurther or follow up visits.  \\nCAN PSORIASIS BE CURED? \\nThere is no cure for psoriasis. However, \\nthere are several effective treatments \\navailable to keep psoriasis well controlled. \\nSpontaneous (or sudden, unexpected) \\nclearance of psoriasis may occur in some \\npeople. \\nHOW CAN PSORIASIS BE TREATED? \\nTreatment of psoriasis depends upon your \\nindividual circumstances. Treatment \\napplied to the surface of your skin (topical \\ntreatment) is sufficient alone in most \\npeople. For individuals with more extensive \\nor difficult to treat psoriasis, ultraviolet light'),\n",

This fact sheet \\nwill give you information on staying safe in the sun so that you can enjoy yourself outside. You will find \\nsections on UVA and UVB rays, sunscreen, top tips for applying sunscreen, and vitamin D.   \\nOur top sun safety tips \\nSun safety doesn’t have to mean total sun avoidance. Instead, we recommend three simple steps to keep \\nsafe in the sun at home or abroad. These will keep you safe from sunburn and reduce your risk of skin \\ncancer in the future. \\n \\n \\nUVA and UVB \\nSun damage is caused by ultraviolet rays from the sun, known as UV rays. Two types of UV rays can \\npenetrate the Earth’s atmosphere, these are called UVA rays and UVB rays. Both types of UV rays are \\nlinked to skin ageing and skin cancer and UVB rays are largely responsible for sunburn. \\nWhen it comes to choosing sunscreen products, it’s important to pick ones that offer both UVB protection \\nand UVA protection. UVB protection is indicated by the SPF (sun protection factor) while UVA protection is \\nindicated by the UVA logo or the UVA star system. With sunscreen this ‘broad -spectrum’ protection is \\nstandard, but other products such as moisturisers and lip balms which offer sun protection sometimes \\nonly offer UVB protection. For more information on sunscreen see our section on sunscreens below.  \\nUnderstanding UV levels \\nThis intensity of the sun’s UV rays changes throughout the day and the year. They tend to peak between \\n11am and 3pm during the summer months and between 10am and 2pm during the winter months. As \\nyou would expect, UV levels are at their highest on a clear day in mid-summer.  \\nUV levels are expressed using the UV index. Most weather apps and forecasts include a UV Index, and you \\ncan also check the UV Index on the Met Office website.'),\n",

In the UK, this is usually between April and \\nSeptember.  \\nFor people with black and brown skin, a UV index rating of 11+ (extremely high on some weather forecast \\napps) is the point at which we recommend sun protection. The maximum UV index in the UK is around 7, \\nso routine sun protection is usually unnecessary for people with these skin tones. However, there are  \\nimportant exceptions to this advice. Sun protection, even in the UK, is important for people with black or \\nbrown skin if:  \\n• You have a skin condition such as photosensitivity, vitiligo, or lupus which makes you more vulnerable \\nto sun damage \\n• If you have a high risk of skin cancer, especially if you are taking immunosuppressive treatments \\n(including organ transplant recipients), or if you are genetically pre-disposed to skin cancer  \\nIn some countries, the UV Index can be extreme and if you plan on spending a prolonged time outdoors \\nyou may wish to follow sun protection advice.  \\nSun exposure can also make hyperpigmentation (spots or patches of darker skin) more noticeable. If this \\nis a concern, follow sun protection advice for the affected area. \\nCheck the UV index forecast to ensure you don't get caught out. \\nMake use of the shade \\nShade is a great way to protect yourself from the sun while enjoying being outside but, depending on the \\nlevel of shade, you may also need to use other forms of protection.  \\nWhen we are outside in the summer, roughly half the UV we are exposed to  comes directly from the sun \\nand the other half is from UV rays scattered in the sky. This means you can sit in the shade and still be \\nexposed to these scattered UV rays.  \\nImagine being under a beach umbrella on a sunny day. Beach umbrellas only offer about 3 to 5 times \\nmore protection than no shade at all. In this instance, effective sun protection may also involve using \\nsunscreen and/or clothing.  \\nIf we wish to achieve a protection factor of 20 or higher from shade alone, we need to block not only \\ndirect sunlight but about 90% of the sky. If you find that hard to picture, this would be the equivalent to \\nthe level of shade provided by a woodland.  \\nProtective clothing – what do we mean? \\nClothing is very effective at protecting against UV from the sun. Importantly, you want good body coverage \\nand fabric which prevents UV radiation from reaching your skin.  \\nSeveral factors affect the UV protection provided by clothing. These include weave density, composition of \\nfibres, colour, thickness, and wetness. \\nStudies carried out on thousands of samples of summer clothing indicate that about two -thirds of \\nsamples offer protection equivalent to SPF 50 or higher with more than 95% providing more than 10 -fold \\nprotection.\"),\n",

This number shows the number of months the product can be used after it has been opened.  \\nSPF in moisturisers \\nThe SPF in moisturisers is tested the same way as SPF in sunscreens. In theory, this means that a \\nmoisturiser with SPF 15 should provide you with the equivalent protection of SPF 15. In reality, the \\nprotection you receive is much lower.  \\nThis is for several reasons. Typically, moisturiser is applied more thinly than sunscreen. Thinner coverage \\nprovides a lower level of sun protection.

Squamous cells are the \\nmain type of cell found in the epidermis.\\nBasal cell layer – This is the lowest layer of the epidermis. It contains \\nbasal cells and cells called melanocytes. The melanocyte cells produce \\na dark pigment called melanin, which gives skin its colour. When skin \\nis exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, melanocytes make melanin \\nto try to protect the skin from getting burnt. This is what causes skin \\nto tan. When melanocytes cluster together, they form non-cancerous \\nspots on the skin called moles or naevi.\\nDermis\\nThis layer of the skin sits below the epidermis.

It develops in the skin cells called \\nmelanocytes (see page 6). Melanoma most often develops in areas \\nthat have been exposed to the sun. It can also start in areas that don’t \\nreceive much sun, such as the eye (uveal or ocular melanoma); nasal \\npassages, mouth and genitals (mucosal melanoma); and the soles of \\nthe feet or palms of the hands, and under the nails (acral melanoma).\\nOther types of skin cancer, called non-melanoma skin cancers or \\nkeratinocyte cancers, are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \\ncell carcinoma (SCC). These are far more common than melanoma. \\nHowever, melanoma is considered more serious because it can \\nspread to other parts of the body , especially if not found early .\\nQ: How common is melanoma?\\nA: Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the \\nworld. Each year in Australia, almost 19,000 people are diagnosed \\nwith invasive melanoma (it has spread into the dermis, the lower \\nlayer of the skin)2. and 28,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma \\nin situ (it is only in the epidermis, the top layer).3 In Australia, \\nmelanoma is the second most common cancer in men and the third \\nmost common in women (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). \\nSigns of melanoma\\nThe ABCD and EFG rule is a tool used by doctors to help them look for \\ncharacteristics of skin damage when diagnosing melanomas.\\nABCD signs\\nAsymmetry Are the halves of each spot different? \\nBorder Are the edges uneven, scalloped or notched?\\nColour Are there differing shades and colour patches?\\nDiameter Is the spot greater than 6 mm across, or is it \\nsmaller than 6 mm but growing larger? \\nEFG signs\\nSome types of melanoma, such as nodular and desmoplastic melanomas \\n(see page 12–13), don’t fit the ABCD guidelines.\\nElevated Is it raised?\\nFirm Is it firm to touch?\\nGrowing Is it growing quickly?\\nFor an overview of what to expect at every stage of your \\ncancer\\xa0care, visit cancer.org.au/cancercareguides/melanoma. \\nThis is a short guide to what is recommended, from diagnosis \\nto treatment and beyond.'),\n",

For areas that are hard to see, use a handheld mirror \\nor\\xa0ask someone to help. It is also a good idea to take a photo of \\nyour moles and spots so that you can compare them with an older \\nphoto to see if one has changed.\\nHow melanoma looks can vary greatly . Look for spots that are new, \\ndifferent from other spots, or raised, firm and growing (see page 9). \\nIf you have lots of moles, a melanoma usually stands out and looks \\ndifferent from other moles. A melanoma is usually brown or black, \\nbut it can also be pink.\\nEven if your doctor has said a spot is benign in the past, check \\nfor any changes in shape, size or colour. If you notice a new or \\nchanging spot, get it checked as soon as possible by your doctor.\\nQ: What causes melanoma?\\nA: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the cause of most types \\nof skin cancer. If unprotected skin is exposed to the sun when the \\nUV index is 3 or above or to other UV radiation, the structure and \\nbehaviour of the cells can change. This can permanently damage \\nthe skin, and the damage builds up every time a person spends time \\nunprotected in the sun.\\nUV radiation most often comes from the sun, but it can also come \\nfrom artificial sources such as solariums (also known as tanning \\nbeds or sun lamps). Solariums are now banned for commercial use \\nin Australia because research shows that people who use solariums \\nhave a much greater risk of developing melanoma.'),\n",

In descriptions of cancer, multiple terms are often conflated but have slightly different technical meanings. \\nCellular proliferation is normally a tightly controlled, cyclical process within the body. 2,6 When this process goes awry, abnormal growths may \\nbegin to form from the affected cells. 2,6 These cells, known as neoplastic cells, divide and proliferate in an unregulated manner and may lose \\ntheir specialized function and appearance, forming a mass or lump of tissue that does not function as normal tissue otherwise would. 1,2 The \\ntechnical term for this state of unregulated growth is neoplasia from the Greek roots neo, meaning “new,” and plasia, meaning “formation.”1 The \\nphysical mass that is formed is called a neoplasm, more commonly referred to as a tumor.1,2 \\nSuch abnormal growths are not necessarily cancerous. Neoplasms can be either benign or malignant, depending on their behavior and \\ncharacteristics.6 If the neoplasm is considered benign, it means it will not invade other unrelated tissues in the body. 1 Benign neoplasms, also \\nknown as benign tumors, are typically slow-growing, localized, and often do not cause any harmful symptoms.1,2\\nLipomas are a well-known example of benign neoplasia.5 Lipomas are benign tumors formed from adipocytes, also known as fat cells.5 These fatty \\ntumors can appear anywhere in the body where normal fat cells are present, making them one of the most common neoplasms found in humans.5 \\nMost lipomas are removed purely for cosmetic reasons, as they are not generally considered to be a health risk.5\\nHowever, some neoplasms may exhibit aggressive, invasive behavior and have the potential to spread to other parts of the body.1 In this case, the \\ngrowth is referred to as a malignant neoplasm, malignant tumor, or, by its common name, cancer. 1 The word cancer comes from the Latin word \\nfor crab, as malignant neoplasms were first described in historical accounts as having a crablike appearance.1\\nMalignant neoplasms pose a more serious threat to health, as they can invade nearby tissues and organs, causing damage and dysfunction. 1,6 \\nMalignant cells can break away from the primary tumor and spread to other parts of the body via the bloodstream or lymphatic system, forming \\nsecondary tumors called metastases.1,6\\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) markers may provide clinicians with valuable information to assist in differentiating benign and malignant \\nneoplasms. For example, the markers MDM2 and CDK4 may guide the differentiation between benign lipomas and malignant liposarcomas, \\ncancerous tumors of fatty tissue.3,4 More recently, p16 has been suggested as a marker to aid in this differentiation as well.3,4\\nTumor Cell Illustration\\nTo learn more about the markers listed above, please visit our website at biocare.net or call 1-800-799-9499, option #3\\n1.“Cancer Terms: Cancer, Neoplasia, Tumor, Neoplasm.” National Cancer Institute SEER Training Modules.

Despite skin pigmentation is primarily related \\nto melanocytes functionality, the surrounding keratinocytes \\nand extracellular matrix proteins and fibroblasts in the under-\\nlying dermal compartment actively contribute to cutaneous \\nhomeostasis.

In particular, an increased expression of \\nsuch mediators and their specific receptors frequently lead to \\nhyperpigmentary conditions, such as in melasma and in solar \\nlentigo, whereas a defect in their expression/release is re-\\nlated to hypopigmented disorders, as seen in vitiligo.

In ve rtebrates, pigmentation var-\\nies widely from black and white stripes of zebra to muted \\nbrowns in sparrows to bright colors of tropical fish. Thus, \\nthe pigmentation system has served as a model for a wide \\nvariety of studies providing some connections between \\ngenotype and phenot ype for evolutionary important pig-\\nmentation traits. Skin color primarily depends on the func-\\ntions of melanocytes, the cells specialized in the synthesis \\nand distribution of the melanin pigment. In the epidermis, \\neach melanocyte is connected through its dendrites with \\napproximately 30 ∼40 keratinocytes, establishing the \\nso-called epidermal melanin unit\\n1, and to fibroblasts in the \\nunderlying dermis. Within melanocytes, melanin synthesis \\noccurs in specialized membra ne-bound organelles termed \\nmelanosomes, characterized by four stages of maturation, \\nalong with they gradually become pigmented. Specialized \\nmelanogenic enzymes within melanosomes, tyrosinase \\nand tyrosinase-related ones, di rect the production of two \\nmelanin types: bl ack-brown eumelanins, the major pig-\\nment found in dark skin and hair, and yellow/red pheome-\\nlanin, mainly observed in red hair and I/II skin photo-\\ntypes\\n2. The number of melanocytes is relatively com-\\nparable among diffe rent ethnicities 3,4 and variations in \\nskin color are mainly dependent on the type (the relative \\nquantity of pheo and eumelani ns) and the amount of mel-\\nanin produced within melanosomes. Size, quantity, dis-\\ntribution and degradation of these structures in the sur-\\nrounding keratinocytes are also determinants in ethnic col-'),\n",

In light skin, melanosomes are smaller and \\nmainly at an early stage of maturation (stages I and II). \\nThey are transferred to keratinocytes as clusters and are \\ndegraded at the level of the spinous layer. In dark skin, \\nthese structures are larger, at stage IV and are singly trans-\\nferred to the surrounding cells. Their degradation appears \\nalso slower than that in the light skin, being some mela-\\nnins yet observed in the stratum corneum\\n5,6. Moreover, \\nthe ratio between pheo and eu melanins appears higher in \\ndark versus light skins (Fig. 1) 7. Besides the underlying bi-\\nological bases, variation in human skin and hair color is \\nthe most notable aspect of human variability and explain-\\ning which mechanisms support differences in skin color \\nacross the world’s populations has been one of the central \\nquestions of human biology. The association of dark skin \\npigmentation with intense su nshine and heat was postu-\\nlated by Aristotle into a “climatic theory” which related \\nhuman features to the environm ent. Later, naturalists such \\nas John Mitchell and Samuel Stanhope Smith related dif-\\nferences in skin pigmentation of world’s people (from light \\ntoward the poles to dark near the equator) to the lat-\\nitudinal gradient sunshine heat\\n8,9. Today we can say more \\nprecisely that variations in sk in color are ad aptive and re-\\nlated to ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels, correlate with lat-\\nitude and represent a solution to the physiological require-\\nments of photoprotection and vitamin D synthesis\\n10. \\nIt is likely that the integument of early members of the \\nhominid family was white or lightly pigmented and cov-\\nered with dark hair. The evolution of a naked, darkly pig-\\nmented integument occurred to protect sweat glands from \\nUV-induced injury thus ensuri ng the quality of somatic \\nthermoregulation. The migratio n of hominids outside of \\nthe tropics placed pressure on skin pigmentation levels be-\\ncause of lower and more seasonal levels of UV. \\nSimultaneously, many degrees of depigmentation evolved \\nto allow UV-B-induced synthesi s of vitamin D. Therefore, \\nthe range of pigmentation ob served in modern humans \\nevolved to favor photoprotectio n near the equator and to \\npromote cutaneous UV-R-induced vitamin D synthesis \\ncloser to the poles. \\nSeveral studies in population genetics have allowed to ex-\\nplain the evolution of human pigmentation system. \\nHowever, the genetics of pigmentation is complex: many \\ngenes, that have been identified for decades by using \\nmouse coat color mutations (and more recently zebrafish), \\nare responsible for the range of pigmentation phenotypes \\ncontributing to human skin pi gment diversity seen both \\nbetween and within human populations\\n11. Moreover, var-\\niants of some of these genes or single-nucleotide poly-\\nmorphisms (SNPs) close to them have been found to con-\\ntribute to normal variation in pigmentary phenotype.

Such genome-wide scans have \\nboth confirmed a role for genes previously identified as \\ncandidates in human pigmen tation and highlighted new \\nloci, thus determining more than one hundred genes that \\nregulate human pigmentary system either directly or \\nindirectly. The expression of such genes is not necessarily \\nconfined to melanocytes\\n12,13.\\nMelanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1R), a G protein-coupled re-\\nceptor that regulates the quantity and quality of melanins \\nproduced, was the first gene identified in humans that is \\ninvolved in regulating mammalian skin and hair color\\n14. It \\nworks by controlling the type  of melanin being produced, \\nand its activation causes the switch from phaeomelanin to \\neumelanin. Mc1R is preferen tially expressed in melano-\\ncytes but not exclusively limited to them since low levels \\nof Mc1R are also detected in  keratinocytes, fibroblasts, \\nand immune cells\\n15. Several studies showed that Mc1R is \\nhighly polymorphic in Nort hern European populations, \\nwhereas is almost without any functionally significant var-\\niation in African populations demonstrating the action of \\nselection to maintain dark pigmentation in high-UV-R en-\\nvironments\\n16,17.\\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS IN THE CONTROL \\nOF SKIN PIGMENTATI ON AND DEFENCES: \\nDERMAL-EPIDERMAL CROSS-TALK\\nThe development and evolution of such a complex pig-\\nmentary system required a fine  and integrated regulation \\nof signalling pathways and cellular interactions. Several \\nautocrine/paracrine secreted  factors and cell adhesion \\nmechanisms involving both epidermal and dermal con-\\nstituents, regulate melanocyte homeostasis, determining \\nthe constitutive skin pigmenta tion and, whenever deregu-\\nlated, the occurrence of pigm entary disorders. Some of \\nthese messengers are produced by both the epidermal and \\ndermal cells, whereas others are distinctly synthesized by \\nonly one type of ce ll. UV exposure is the main environ-\\nmental factor influencing sk in pigmentation. Following \\nUV irradiation, pigment redistribution in keratinocytes and \\nskin is stimulated, melanogenesis is increased and the syn-\\nthesis and secretion of many pro-pigmenting factors are \\nup-regulated. All these factors act by binding to their spe-\\ncific receptors followed by activation of intracellular sig-\\nnalling pathways linked to melanocyte functionality. \\nAmong such growth factor/receptor signalling cascades, \\none of the main pathway is constituted by the pro-opiome-\\nlanocortin (POMC) derived peptides (melanocyte-stimulat-\\ning hormone [MSH] and adrenocorticotropic hormone) \\nfrom keratinocytes and their receptor Mc1R. Following \\nUV exposure the transcription of POMC is stimulated by \\nthe induction of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in kera-\\ntinocytes, thus promoting me lanin synthesis in melano-\\ncytes via paracrine interactions\\n18. As previously men-\\ntioned, Mc1R mutations, which are more frequently ob-\\nserved in light than in dark skin phototypes, may dereg-\\nulate the cellular responses to α-MSH, resulting in de-\\ncreased eumelanin production in both constitutive and \\nUV-mediated pigmentation.\\nAlong with α-MSH, melanocyte growth, differentiation, \\nsurvival and activity are re gulated by other keratino-\\ncyte-derived growth factors and cytokines including endo-\\nthelin (ET)-1, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), stem \\ncell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulat-\\ning factor (GM-CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). As \\nwell as α-MSH, most of these messengers are up-regu-\\nlated in response to UV: ET-1 binds to its specific receptor \\nendothelin B receptor on melanocytes but it also enhan-\\nces the expression of Mc1R\\n19. Its effect results in the in-\\ncrease of both melanocyte proliferation and melano-\\ngenesis\\n19,20 and, as for POMC, ET-1 synthesis is induced \\nby p5321. Upon specific stimuli, e.g. during inflammatory \\nprocesses, several other me diators, including prosta-\\nglandins E2 and F2alpha, thromboxane B2, leukotriene \\n(LT) C4 and LTD4 are released by the surrounding micro-\\nenvironment and activate melanocytes increasing their \\ndendricity and melanin production\\n22. Adding complexity \\nto the interplay between keratinocytes and melanocytes, a \\ncontribution of the eumelanin intermediate 5,6-dihydrox-\\nyindole-2-carboxylic acid, which goes beyond the supply-\\ning of pigments, has been s hown: the diffusion of this \\nchemical messenger from the producing melanocytes into \\nkeratinocytes may provide protection against environ-\\nmental stimuli such as UV, through the increase of the an-\\ntioxidant defence systems and differentiation in keratino-\\ncytes, thus contributing to the overall epidermis pro-\\ntection23. \\nSome studies highlight the role of beta defensins, small \\nand hydrophobic members of highly conserved gene fami-\\nlies exhibiting antimicrobial activity against a variety of \\ngram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, yeast and vi-\\nruses, in mediating also human pigmentation. More pre-\\ncisely, some results expand the functional role of beta de-\\nfensins revealing the cross-talk between beta defensins \\nand the melanocortin system. In  fact, at least two human \\nbeta defensins, human β-defensin (hBD) 1 and hBD3 \\nmay modulate melanocortin receptor signaling \\nin vivo , \\nacting not only on Mc1R but also on Mc5R 24. Abdel \\nMalek’s group defined the role of hBD3 on human pig-\\nmentation testing its effe cts on cultured human mela-'),\n",

HBD3 inhibited α-MSH-induced, but not the for-\\nskolin-induced increase in  cyclic adenosine monopho-\\nsphate (cAMP) levels, thus suggesting that hBD3 acted by \\nblocking the Mc1R\\n25. Moreover, dysregulated expression \\nof hBD3 in the skin may also impair DNA repair re-\\nsponses in UV-induced melanocytes and, consequently, \\nimprove melanoma risk\\n26.\\nParallel to the paracrine influences via keratinocytes, mel-\\nanocyte functionality and skin pigmentation are regulated \\nby the active role of both extracellular matrix (ECM) pro-\\nteins and fibroblasts of the dermal compartment. \\nIn vitro \\nstudies demonstrated the mi togenic and melanogenic in-\\nfluences of ECM proteins such as fibronectin, collagen I \\nand IV on normal human melanocytes and their effect in \\ninhibiting cell vacuolization and death when melanocytes \\nwere growing in mitogen-deficient medium 27. In addition, \\nlaminins and collagen IV are involved in the adhesion of \\nmelanocytes to the basement membrane via integrin inter-\\nactions\\n28. Dermal fibroblasts release many soluble factors \\nable to modulate melanocyte activity: some of these fac-\\ntors are produced also by keratinocytes, such as SCF and \\nHGF, others are specifically synthesized by fibroblasts. \\nMost of these messengers fa vour melanin synthesis and \\nmelanocyte proliferation. Among them, neuregulin-1 is \\nup-regulated in fibroblasts obtained from type VI skin re-\\nspect to those from types I and III and it represents a mela-\\nnogenic factor in the regula tion of the constitutive pig-\\nmentation level of darker skin\\n29. It has been demonstrated \\nthat fibroblasts from palmoplantar skin produce higher \\nlevels of the Wnt pathway an tagonist dickkopf 1 (DKK1) \\nrespect to fibroblasts of the trunk. Differently from the \\ngrowth factors described above, DKK1 exerts an inhibitory \\neffect on melanocyte proliferation and pigment production. \\nMoreover, this soluble factor  acts also on keratinocytes, \\nreducing the expression level of the proteinase-activated \\nreceptor-2, which is involved in melanosome transfer, \\nthus decreasing also this la tter process. These combined \\neffects of DKK1 on both melanocytes and keratinocytes \\ndetermine the physiological  hypopigmentation observed \\nin the epidermis of palms and soles\\n30. The fibroblast \\ngrowth factor family member keratinocyte growth factor/fi-\\nbroblast growth factor 7 (KGF/FGF7) induces melanosome \\ntransfer, promoting the phagot ytic process via activation \\nand signalling of its specific receptor, keratinocyte growth \\nfactor receptor, directly in keratinocytes 31,32. Moreover, \\nthis growth factor stimulates the production and secretion \\nof the promelanogenic mediat or SCF in primary keratino-\\ncytes, creating an indirect paracrine network connecting \\nkeratinocytes and fibroblasts in  the control of melanocyte \\nfunctions\\n33. The important role of KGF in promoting skin \\npigmentation is further demonstrated by additional studies \\nshowing the ability of KGF alone and in association with \\nIL1alpha to increase melanin production and deposition in \\npigmented epidermal equivalents and in human skin ex-\\nplants\\n34. Besides these autocrine and paracrine inter-\\nactions, melanocyte functions are also influenced by hor-\\nmonal factors distally produced, as assessed by the varia-\\ntion of pigmentation observed in the course of endocrine \\nchanges e.g.: (i) hyperpigmentation detected during preg-\\nnancy as a result of increased estrogen levels; (ii) hyper-\\npigmentation of genital area s due to the action of re-\\nproductive hormones\\n35,36.\\nOne basic function of the skin is the prevention of water \\nloss from the body. This may represent the first physio-\\nlogical demand for protection, but  it is equally true that \\nthe skin provides a protective barrier against invading mi-\\ncrobial pathogens, while also serving as a habitat for a ple-\\nthora of commensal bacteria . The stratum corneum pro-\\nvides the first line of defense against pathogenic and envi-\\nronmental assaults and, in fact, the barrier functions of the \\nstratum corneum are interrelated, co-regulated and inter-\\ndependent. The cohe sive structure of the stratum cor-\\nneum, coupled with its low water content and its acidic \\npH, allows the growth of the normal flora, while providing \\na formidable layer of the innate immune system that coun-\\nteracts the invasion of pathogens\\n37. \\nThe recent skin microbiome an alysis of monozygotic and \\ndizygotic Korean twins has allowed to identify and dis-\\ncriminate genetic and environmental effects on the \\nmicrobiome. In particular, the paper reported a strong as-\\nsociation between the composition of skin microbiota and \\nhuman genetic factors related to skin barrier function\\n38. \\nThe stratum corneum is a multilayered tissue composed of \\nflattened and anucleate corneocytes, surrounded by many \\nlamellae sheets, enriched in ceramides, cholesterol, and \\nfree fatty acids. The positioning of these highly hydro-\\nphobic lipids within the extrace llular domains of the stra-\\ntum corneum inhibits the outside movement of water\\n39. \\nHowever, the lamellar bodies secrete not only lipids but \\nalso proteolytic enzymes a nd antimicrobial peptides \\n(AMPs) including corneodesmosin, hBD-2 and the cath-\\nelicidin product, LL-37 by which, after recognizing mi-\\ncrobes via Toll-like receptors or NOD-like receptors, the \\nstratum corneum initiates the defense response.

Accordingly, natural selection would have fa-\\nvored mutations that increase and protect permeability \\nbarrier function and, in fact, pigmented skin displays supe-\\nrior barrier function\\n43. On the other hand, the thicknesses \\nof the stratum corneum is higher in not pigmented skin of \\npatients affected by vitiligo, thus giving to the barrier a \\nphotoprotective role compensating for absent pigmenta-\\ntion\\n44. Moreover, very recently, a dysbiosis in the diversity \\nof microbial community structure in vitiligo lesional skin \\nhas been reported45.\\nA further corroboration that skin pigmentation is in-\\ntricately regulated may be also  supported by the link, re-\\ncently demonstrated, between α-MSH and the perox-\\nisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ in melano-\\ncytes46. Several lines of evidence indicate that cAMP is the \\nmain intracellular messenger responsible for the melano-\\ngenic actions of α-MSH\\n47. Moreover, Mc1R signaling re-\\ncruits c-KIT to activate E RK pathway inde pendently on \\ncAMP in normal human melanocytes and melanoma \\ncells\\n48. α-MSH-induced melanogenesis may also correlate \\nwith the canonical Wnt/ β-catenin pathway activity 49. \\nMore recently it has been demonstrated that α-MSH acti-\\nvates PPAR- γ and such activation depends on the in-\\nduction of the phosphatidylinositol (PI(4,5)P 2/PLCβ) sig-\\nnalling pathway. Therefore, the receptor Mc1R drives mel-\\nanogenesis and proliferation through lipid mediators. In \\nfact, α-MSH treatment failed to reduce cell proliferation \\nrates after PPAR-γ inhibition. In agreement with these data, \\nKang and co-workers\\n50 investigated in a previous study the \\nexpression and function of pe roxisome PPARs, which be-\\nlong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that hetero-\\ndimerize with the retinoic X receptor and initially known \\nfor their important role in fat metabolism and adipocyte \\ndifferentiation, on melanocyte proliferation, differentiation \\nand melanogenesis. Moreover, PPAR- γ induces differ-\\nentiation and increases cell antioxidant defense in re-\\nsponse to natural or pharmacological agonists both in mel-\\nanocytes and melanoma cells\\n51. \\nDEREGULATION OF THE EPIDERMAL-DERMAL \\nINTERPLAY IN PIGMENTARY DISORDERS: \\nPATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS \\nIncreased production of one or more of pro-melanogenic \\nfactors often associated to an altered expression of their re-\\nceptors have been detected in several hyperpigmentary \\ndisorders. Solar/senile lentigines (SLs) are hyperpigmented \\nlesions mainly localized on photodamaged body sites, \\nwhose onset is commonly observed along with aging. The \\nunderlying mechanisms responsible for the occurence and \\nmaintainance of these spots are not yet completely \\ndefined. Molecules related to inflammatory and fatty acid \\nmetabolism are induced in SL, probably linked to chron-\\nical UV exposure. Deregulation in the expression of sev-\\neral pro-melanogenic factors has been demonstrated, in-\\nvolving both keratinocyte- and fibroblast-derived network. \\nIn lesional epidermis, ET-1 and its receptor ET-B, SCF and \\nits receptor c-Kit signalling cascades are up-modulated, as \\nwell as the expression of α-MSH and Mc1R\\n52. p53 has \\nbeen shown to play an important role in the onset of these \\nspots through its ability to induce the pro-pigmenting cyto-\\nkines ET-1, SCF and POMC. In SL lesions, the expression \\nof KGF and its receptor appears to be increased at ear-\\nly-mid stages, suggesting the involvement of this growth \\nfactor in the onset of the pigmented spots. Moreover, the \\ntreatment with KGF and KGF as sociated with IL-1alpha, \\ninduces hyperpigmented lesions \\nin vivo34,53. In SL the in-\\nduction of pro-melanogenic gr owth factors signalling cas-\\ncades has been highlighted also in the dermis, with high \\nexpression of KGF, SCF and HG F in lesional fibroblasts. \\nThe crucial contribution of the dermis and, specifically, of \\nphotoaged fibroblasts in the formation of SL hyper-\\npigmentation are now increasingly strengthened by a \\nnumber of \\nin vitro models reported in the literature: (i) a \\nhigher expression of KGF, SCF and HGF using a model of \\nstress-induced premature sene scence in fibroblasts has \\nbeen reported33; (ii) Salducci et al. 54 showed the ability of \\nconditioned medium produced by UV-exposed aged fi-\\nbroblasts to induce the main SL features in pigmented re-\\nconstructed epidermis; (iii) Duval et al.\\n55 demonstrated an \\nincreased epidermal pigmentation in a reconstructed skin \\nmodel containing natural photo-aged fibroblasts. Very \\nrecently, an increased expression of KGF in SL has been \\nreported also in the epidermal compartment, supporting \\nthe hypothesis that the transfer and accumulation of this fi-\\nbroblast-derived growth fact or into the epidermis may \\nlead to the persistence of hyperpigmentation\\n56. In the pro-\\ngression of this altered dermal-epidermal interplay, it has \\nbeen suggested that an incr eased diffusion of heparin- \\nbinding growth factors such as FGFs, HGF, GM-CSF from \\ndermis to epidermis and vice  versa may be favoured by \\nthe reported heparanase-induced  degradation of heparan \\nsulfate at the base ment membrane observed in solar lenti-\\ngo\\n57. Alterations in the melanogenic cytokine networks is \\npresent also in melasma, an  hyperpigmented dysfunction \\nprimarily localized on sun-exposed sites, generally the \\nface.

In addition, the basement \\nmembrane in lesional skin appears distrupted and dis-\\norganized, with the presence of the so called pendulous \\nmelanocytes. The expression of  the metalloproteinase 2 is \\nalso increased due to the ch ronic UV exposure and such \\nup-modulation is possibly resp onsible for the dysfunction \\nof the basement membrane. These changes may, in turn, \\nexcessively activate the dermal-epidermal interactions, fur-\\nther underscoring the crucial role of the signalling net-\\nwork among melanocytes and ot her skin cell populations \\nin the formation of melasma lesions\\n60,61. An increased \\nnumber of blood vessels associated with an up-modu-\\nlation of the vascular endothe lial growth factor have been \\nalso detected, highlighting the presence of an altered vas-\\ncularization in melasma lesions\\n62. Lastly, likewise solar \\nlentigo, accumulation of the melanogenic factor KGF in \\nthe lesional epidermis has been observed56. Very recently, \\nan up-regulation of the secret ed frizzled-ralated protein 2 \\n(sFRP2) in the skin of melasma, solar lentigo and acutely \\nUV-irradiated skin has been shown. This over-expression \\nleads to increased melanogenesis through the activation of \\nthe β-catenin signalling and t hus up-regulation of MITF \\nand tyrosinase in melanocytes. Interestingly, a strong ex-\\npression of sFRP2 was detected in lesional fibroblasts, fur-\\nther demonstrating the crucial role of the epithelial-mesen-\\nchymal interplay in the control of physiological and \\npathological skin pigmentation\\n63. One more, an un-\\nbalance of fibroblast-derived growth factors able to stim-\\nulate melanocyte and induce pigmentation has been ob-\\nserved in other pigmentary disorders: (i) in the benign fi-\\nbroblastic tumor dermatofibroma, the hyperpigmentation \\noften observed in the above epidermis, has been attrib-\\nuted to the increased secreti on of SCF and HGF by the fi-\\nbroblastic tumour cells\\n64; (ii) similarly, an heightened re-\\nlease of the same two growth factors by fibroblasts has \\nbeen suggested to be involv ed in the epidermal hyper-\\npigmentation of café-au lait macules of neurofibromatosis \\ntype 1 (NF1) patients65; (iii) An increased expression of the \\nfibroblast-derived growth factors SCF, HGF and KGF in \\nthe dermis of two patients with a generalized, progressive \\ndyschromatosis disorder 66. Likewise, the hyper-\\npigmentation sometimes observed in both basal cell carci-\\nnoma (BCC) and seborrhoeic keratosis (SK) has been \\nlinked to an accentuated expression of the keratino-\\ncyte-derived ET-1 67,68 (Fig. 2). Taken together, all these \\nstudies show how intricate is the interplay among dermal \\nand epidermal cells with me lanocytes and how the varia-\\ntion of one or more of these interactions can result in a va-\\nriety of different hyperpigme nted lesions. On the other \\nhand, changes in the synthesis and release of these mes-\\nsengers has been observed in hypopigmented disorders \\nsuch as vitiligo. Despite significant studies contributed to a \\ngreater knowledge of vitiligo, understanding its patho-\\ngenesis is still a challenge. Vitiligo is characterized by the \\ndisappearance of functional melanocytes, and multiple \\nmechanisms might contribute to this loss, including genet-\\nic defects, metabolic abnormalities, oxidative stress, gen-\\neration of inflammatory mediators, cell detachment and \\nautoimmune responses. Nevertheless, a growing amount \\nof evidence in recent years ar gues for intrinsic metabolic \\ndefects in melanocytes leading to an intracellular oxida-\\ntive stress that may act as the initial signal transduction \\nsustaining cell degeneration\\n69. Such metabolic impairment \\nmay be not restricted to melanocytes but also extended to \\ndermal cells 70. According to the idea that an increase of \\noxidative stress and impaired ability to effectively manage \\nstressful stimuli are some of the hallmarks of vitiligo skin, \\nmelanocytes from non lesional areas show alterations of \\nsome pathways, including hyperactivation of mi-\\ntogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cyclic AMP re-\\nsponse element-binding protein (CREB), and p53 over-ex-\\npression, leading to a condition of stress induced pre-\\nmature senescence-like phenotype which is characterized \\nby the production of IL-6, ma trix metalloproteinase 3, cy-\\nclooxygenase 2, and insulin- like growth factor-binding \\nprotein 3 (IGFBP3) and IGFBP7\\n71. Among the alterations \\nreported in vitiligo skin, changes in the production of ker-\\natinocyte-derived factors have been described by several \\nauthors, showing either an up- or a down-modulation: \\nKitamura et al.\\n72 described an increased expression of \\nET-1 and SCF transcripts associated with an higher SCF \\nprotein expression in lesional versus non-lesional vitiligo \\nepidermis. The authors reported also a selective defi-\\nciency in the expression of SCF receptor c-KIT and MITF at \\nthe edge of the lesion, suggesting that the reduced func-\\ntion of the SCF/c-KIT signalling cascade may contribute to \\nmelanocyte alterations and lo ss. On the other hand, other \\ngroups demonstrated a reduced production of SCF by ker-\\natinocytes of the depigmented epidermis, possibly due to \\na higher vulnerability of these cells to apoptosis. \\nConsequenlty, this reduced secretion of surviving factors \\nmay concur to melanocyte death\\n73,74. In lesional skin, a \\nlower expression of GM-CSF, bFGF and ET-1, associated \\nwith a higher amount of the melanocyte inhibitor cyto-\\nkines IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor- α have been also re-\\nported\\n75 evidencing, altogether, the contribution of kerati-'),\n",

Recently, an altered pattern of dis-\\ntribution of the adhesion mo lecule E-cadherin has been \\ndescribed in clinically normal pigmented skin, indicating \\nthe presence of melanocyte adhesiveness impairment that, \\nin presence of stress, may f acilitate and contribute to mel-\\nanocyte loss\\n76. In the dermis, a reduction in the expression \\nof collagen IV and an up-regulation of the ECM protein te-\\nnascin have been de scribed, possibly linked to the de-\\ncreased adhesion of vitiligo melanocytes 77,78. As well, an \\nhigher expression of the melanocyte inhibitor fibro-\\nblast-derived factor DKK1 has been reported in lesional \\nversus non lesional dermis\\n79. A lower production and re-\\nlease of KGF by lesional fibroblasts, resulting in a reduc-\\ntion of melanosome transfer, has been recently described \\nas an additional factor contributing to vitiligo hypo-\\npigmentation\\n80 (Fig. 3). In the treatment of vitiligo, re-\\npigmentation frequently begins in the peri-follicular area. \\nThis likely arises from the reservoir of melanocyte stem \\ncells (MelSCs) in the hair follicle bulge 81.

Quiescence, \\nmaintenance, activation and proliferation of MelSC are \\nmediated by specific activities in the microenvironment \\nthat can influence the differentiation and regeneration of \\nmelanocytes. In response to wouding or UV irradiation, \\nfollicular MelSC migrate towards the basal layer of the \\nepidermis and differentiate into functional epidermis \\nmelanocytes. This migration behavior of MelSC following \\nenvironmental stimuli gives the opportunity to develop \\ntherapeutic approaches for treating skin hypopigmentation \\ndisorders by manipulating this stem cell population. For is-\\ntance, narrow-band UV-B exposure has been used to treat \\npatient with vitiligo, thus leading to follicular repigmen-\\ntation of depigmented skin. The mechanicistic rationale \\nunderlying the success of this therapy is related to the pro-\\nliferation, migration and differentiation of MelSC\\n83.\\nNevertheless, during vitiligo treatment some areas are re-\\nfractory to repigmentation  such as hands and feet 84. The \\nmost relevant reason seems to be the lower melanocyte \\ndensity, lower melanocyte stem cells reservoirs and lower \\nbaseline levels of epidermal stem cell requiring factors\\n85. \\nThe maturation and function of hair follicle stem cells are \\nregulated by dermal cells, in cluding adipocytes, dermal \\npapilla cells and fibroblasts, and it is plausible that meta-\\nbolic impairment of dermal cells will affect stem cells. \\nMoreover, the Herlyn group demonstrated that when der-\\nmal stem cells are embedded into dermis, a subpopulation \\nmigrates to the epidermis and differentiates into melano-\\ncytes\\n86.\\nMelanocyte stem cells have also been identified in the \\nsweat glands of volar skin and they can contribute to the \\nepidermal melanocyte population87. Furthermore, possible \\nexistence of melanocytes or melanoblasts has been ob-\\nserved in human sebaceous glands88.\\nCONCLUSIONS \\nUnderstanding the developm ent and evolution of pig-\\nmentary system requires the knowledge of cellular inter-\\nactions and signaling pathways producing this system. The \\ncolour of human skin is determined by the amount and \\ntype of melanin pigment pr oduced by melanocytes and \\ntransferred to keratinocytes. Nevertheless, the range of \\nphenotypic differences in pigmentary traits it is not only \\nattributed to melanocyte cells but it certainly encompasses \\nother skin cell populations. Changes in these interactions \\nare likely to explain some ethnic differences and, when-\\never deregulated, the occurren ce of pigmentary disorders \\ncharacterized by either hyper- or hypo-pigmentation.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nWe thank Marco Zaccarini, Dermatopathology Unit, San \\nGallicano Dermatologic Institute for technical assistance.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\122 - Vitiligo-New Indication.pdf'}, page_content='Executive Summary \\nVitiligo is an acquired pigmentary skin condition characterized by immune-\\nmediated destruction of melanocytes and by the decrease or absence of pigmentary \\ncells from the epidermis leading to the formation of white macules and patches on \\nthe body1. Vitiligo is associated with few autoimmune disorders; thyroid disorders \\nbeing mostly prominent2. The etiology and pathogenic mechanisms of vitiligo are \\nstill poorly understood which has hindered the progress in diagnosis and treatment3. \\nVitiligo is classified into 3 subtypes based on distribution: generalized, segmental, \\nand localized2. Generalized vitiligo (also referred to as non-segmental vitiligo), which \\nis the most common form of vitiligo, involves loss of pigment (depigmentation) in \\npatches of skin all over the body. Segmental vitiligo is an uncommon form of \\nlocalized vitiligo, characterized by dermatomal distribution. It is often unilateral, \\nasymmetrical and never crosses the midline of body. Localized vitiligo is \\ncharacterized by the development of a few patches that appear in one or few areas \\nof the body. The degree of severity of the disease depends on the body surface \\naffected. \\nVitiligo can be manifested as distinct clinical variants: trichrome (lesions that have a \\ntan zone of varying width between normal and totally depigmented skin, which \\nexhibits an intermediate hue4), marginal inflammatory (a unique subset of vitiligo \\nvulgaris presenting with scattered depigmented, pruritic patches surrounded by a \\nraised, erythematous border5), quadrichrome (additional presence of marginal or \\nperifollicular hyperpigmentation; recognized more frequently in darker skin types, \\nparticularly in areas of repigmentation), and pentachrome (additional blue-gray \\nhyperpigmented macules, representing areas of melanin incontinence). Less \\ncommon variants include the confetti type or vitiligo ponctue. (Several tiny, discrete \\nhypomelanotic macules6). Finally, the Koebner Phenomenon is described as vitiligo \\nfollowing an injury to the skin, such as a scratch, scrape, or burn7. Initial lesions occur \\nmost frequently on the hands, forearms, feet, and face, favoring a periocular or \\nperioral distribution2. Other patterns include lip-tip vitiligo (affecting mostly the lips \\nand fingertips), acrofacial vitiligo (involves the lips or other parts of the face plus the \\nhands and/or feet), and focal vitiligo (affects only a small area of the body)7. Finally, \\nuniversal vitiligo involves most of the body7.'),\n",

Retrieved from https://www.umassmed.edu/vitiligo/blog/blog-\\nposts1/2020/05/patterns-of-vitiligo/  \\nUnderreporting of vitiligo across all skin types may be a concern, as some healthcare \\nproviders may perceive it as a cosmetic issue rather than recognizing it as a well-\\ndefined autoimmune disease8. \\nThe global prevalence of vitiligo is estimated to range from 0.5% to 2% of the \\npopulation; the prevalence reported by most studies is 0.6%. However, it is important \\nto bear in mind that Vitiligo prevalence rates vary geographically. For instance, \\nhigher prevalence rates are recorded in Africa and India8. In Saudi Arabia, as of 2020, \\nthe prevalence of Vitiligo was reported at 3.12%9. Vitiligo is found to affect both males \\nand females at similar rates and is not limited to specific racial, ethnic, or \\nsocioeconomic groups. While it can manifest at any age, it is most commonly \\nobserved during the second and third decades of life. Approximately one-third of \\nindividuals with vitiligo develop the condition during childhood, while a significant \\nmajority, around 70% to 80%, experience its onset before reaching the age of 30 \\nyears10. \\nVitiligo manifests clinically as white patches on the skin, appearing in a symmetrical \\npattern. These patches are especially prominent in individuals with darker skin \\ntones. The affected areas are distinguishable by clearly defined, pearly white or \\ndepigmented spots and irregularly shaped macules and patches, which can be oval, \\nround, or linear in form. Their edges are raised, varying in size from a few millimeters \\nto centimeters, and they expand outward from the center. Depigmentation may \\nlead to psychological distress, social stigmatization, and low self-esteem2.'),\n",

In addition, cochlear melanocyte loss may lead to hearing \\nloss. Other complications that are likely to be burdensome to the patient’s quality of \\nlife include social stigmatization and mental stress2.  \\nThis report compiles all clinical and economic evidence related to vitiligo according \\nto the relevant sources. The ultimate objective of issuing Vitiligo guidelines by the \\nCouncil of Health Insurance is to update the IDF (CHI Drug Formulary) with the best \\navailable clinical and economic evidence related to drug therapies, ensuring \\ntimely and safe access to vitiligo patients in Saudi Arabia. The main focus of the \\nreview was on North American, European and other International guidelines issued \\nwithin the last five years. To elaborate, North American guidelines detailed \\nprognostic factors as well as pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches \\nfor the management of vitiligo. Furthermore, European guidelines emphasize \\ndiagnosis, classification, therapy, and supportive care for vitiligo. International \\nguidelines elaborated on treatment of vitiligo aimed at children, pregnant patients, \\nnursing mothers and the elderly. \\nMain recommendations issued by different Health Technology Assessment (HTA) \\nbodies on the use of the current medications in Vitiligo were reviewed and \\nsummarized under each drug therapy table in Section 2.0. These include the \\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Canadian Agency for \\nDrugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), the \\nInstitute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWIG), and the Pharmaceutical \\nBenefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).  \\nThe management of vitiligo involves a multidisciplinary approach. Various methods \\nare employed for treating vitiligo, encompassing a range of topical and systemic \\nmedications, phototherapy, laser therapy, and surgical interventions. Topical \\ntreatments consist of corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and vitamin-D analogs. \\nPhototherapy, specifically narrowband UV-B with a 311-312nm wavelength, is a highly \\neffective treatment, promoting repigmentation in early and localized cases.

It was published in two parts: the first covered the epidemiology, \\nquality of life, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, associations, histopathology, etiology, \\nand work-up17, and the second detailed the treatment options and approach to \\ntreatment13. For brevity purposes, only part II will be included in this report. The main \\nrecommendations issued are detailed below13:  \\n• There are various treatment options for vitiligo: these include but are not \\nlimited to non-surgical, surgical, and alternative options. \\n• Nonsurgical options include pharmacological approaches (using topical or \\nsystemic therapy), phototherapy, photochemotherapy, and laser therapy. \\n• Surgical options include melanocyte cell suspension transplantation and skin \\ngrafting. \\n• Other suggested approaches include camouflage products, psychotherapy, \\nand depigmentation therapy. \\n• The treatment efficacy is based on several factors such as the type of vitiligo \\nthat the patient is subjected to, the duration and distribution of the disease \\nand the use of combination regimens in the treatment process.  \\nIndividual Prognostic Factors:  \\n• In patients who are left untreated, disease progression is attributed to \\nmucosal involvement, a family history of vitiligo, the Koebner Phenomenon, \\nand the presence of non-segmental vitiligo. \\n• Patients with the following characteristics are more likely to respond to \\ntherapy: younger patients, those with recent onset of disease, darker skin \\ntypes, and lesions of the face, neck, and trunk.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\122 - Vitiligo-New Indication.pdf'}, page_content='1. Pharmacological Therapy \\na. Corticosteroids \\n• The first line therapy for vitiligo is topical corticosteroid (CS) therapy; these \\nagents may be used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy.  \\n• Systemic corticosteroids play an important role in stopping disease \\nprogression and inducing repigmentation; however, limitations to their use \\ninclude their side effect profile.  \\n• If patients are treated with corticosteroids, frequent monitoring and regular \\nsteroid holidays are recommended to limit and potentially prevent side \\neffects.  \\n• Higher response rates are seen in children compared to adults with head and \\nneck lesions having the greatest response to treatment. \\n• Regardless of route, CS combination with light therapy yields a favorable \\noutcome. \\nb. Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors \\n• The off-label use of topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) has been shown to be \\nsafe and effective in the treatment of vitiligo for both adults and children. \\n• TCIs are also known to enhance the effect of light/laser therapy. \\n• Given the lack of local side effects and efficacy comparable to topical CSs, TCIs \\nare appropriate for intermittent long-term use and for those who cannot \\ntolerate topical CSs.  \\n• Face and neck lesions respond best, and occlusion may help with recalcitrant \\nlesions on the extremities. \\n• Concerns regarding potential systemic absorption may be alleviated by \\nlimiting the application of TCIs to a small body surface area, such as the face.  \\nc. Vitamin D3 Analogs \\n• Calcipotriene is a topical vitamin D3 analog with an antiproliferative effect on \\nkeratinocytes, an immunomodulatory effect, and an ability to enhance \\nmelanocyte development and melanogenesis.  \\n• Topical vitamin D3 analogs are mostly beneficial when combined with topical \\nCS; repigmentation rates increase, the delay in the onset of repigmentation \\nshortens, and there is a greater stability of repigmentation compared with \\neither, as monotherapy. The combination therapy is effective in some \\npreviously steroid nonresponsive patients.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\122 - Vitiligo-New Indication.pdf'}, page_content='• Off-label use of the fixed-combination calcipotriene 0.005% and \\nbetamethasone 0.05% topical products once daily is another treatment \\noption. \\n2. Phototherapy \\n• Phototherapy is ideally reserved for patients who fail topical therapy or for \\nthose with lesions of large surface areas. \\n• Narrowband UVB phototherapy is superior to PUVA phototherapy – \\nspecifically, 311nm NBUVB; however, PUVA yields quicker results. \\n• UVA phototherapy is almost always given in conjunction with Psoralen (A \\nphotosensitizer); however, the combination increases the risk of melanoma \\nand nonmelanoma skin cancers.  \\n3. Laser Therapy \\n• The Monochromatic Excimer Laser or MEL (308nm) is the most used laser \\ntherapy for the treatment of Vitiligo. \\n• As per Casacci et al18, MEL has proven to lead to better clinical outcomes \\ncompared to NBUVB phototherapy. \\n• In most clinical trials, the MEL is used one to three times a week for an initial \\ncourse of 12 weeks; 11 to 22 sessions are required on average to see \\nrepigmentation, more in poorly responsive acral areas. \\n• Bioskin, a device regarded as microphototherapy, transmits focused 311nm \\nUVB phototherapy; all other tested modalities resulted in enhanced \\nrepigmentation rates when used in combination with Bioskin compared to \\nuse as monotherapy.  \\n• For patients with segmental vitiligo who have poorer responses to \\nconventional treatment compared to non-segmental vitiligo, the 632.8-nm \\nhelium neon (HeNe) laser is recommended; whereby, repigmentation begins \\nfollowing 16 to 17 treatments; however, this is not a standard therapy regimen. \\n4. Photochemotherapy \\n• The furocoumarin psoralens 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), 5-methoxypsoralen \\n(5-MOP), and trimethylpsoralen (TMP) have been successfully used for the \\nmanagement of vitiligo when given in combination with UVA therapy. \\n• The use of topical 8-MOP is limited to patients with small lesions (< 5% body \\nsurface area), or who are younger than 12 years of age in whom systemic \\nPsoralen/Ultraviolet A Radiation (PUVA) phototherapy is contraindicated.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\122 - Vitiligo-New Indication.pdf'}, page_content='• Regimen: the frequency of treatment is one to three times per week.  \\nTwenty to thirty minutes after application of an even layer, the skin is exposed \\nto UVA radiation, initially at 0.25 to 0.5 J/cm2.  \\nTwo to three times a week, exposure time is increased in small steps (15-30 \\nseconds) up to a maximum of 10 minutes. Then, a marginally higher strength \\nof topical psoralen preparation is prescribed, and the same time intervals are \\nfollowed.  \\nThis procedure is repeated until a dosage and exposure time are attained that \\nproduce erythema but not burning.  \\nThe patients need to wash off the remaining 8-MOP with soap and water \\nimmediately after the irradiation and apply UVA sunblock to avoid additional \\nenvironmental UVA exposure. \\n• It is suggested that another agent, Khellin, is administered topically or orally \\nand is said to have vasodilatory effects.  \\nStudies suggest that Khellin exhibits a stimulatory effect on melanogenesis \\nand melanocyte proliferation when combined with UVA light.  \\nCompared directly to PUVA, Khellin/Ultraviolet A Radiation (KUVA) \\nphototherapy required higher doses and a longer duration of treatment to \\nachieve the same response, but patients experienced fewer side effects than \\nwith PUVA phototherapy. \\n• L-Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid used in the initiation of \\nmelanogenesis in melanocytes. It can be applied topically or taken orally. \\nTreatment of vitiligo with L-Phe can be used for any patient with access to \\nnatural or UVA light.  \\nThe patient population who responds best is that with less than 25% body \\nsurface area affected, a disease onset before 21 years of age, and with \\ngeneralized, symmetrical lesions. \\n5. Antioxidants \\n• Topical and oral antioxidants may have a role in protecting melanocytes from \\ndestruction by reactive oxygen species. They are given as adjunct therapies. \\n• Vitamin E, vitamin C, alphalipoic acid, ginkgo biloba, topical catalase, \\nsuperoxide dismutase, and polypodium leucotomos have been used in \\nvitiligo.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\122 - Vitiligo-New Indication.pdf'}, page_content='6. Surgical Therapies \\n• Surgical treatment should be reserved for patients with stable vitiligo \\nrefractory to non-surgical therapy. \\n• Surgical procedures include blister graft, split-thickness skin graft, punch graft \\nand autologous melanocyte suspension transplant. \\n• The blister graft and punch graft are more favorable since they do not require \\ngeneral anesthesia and leave the patient unscathed.  \\n• The split-thickness skin graft can be useful to cover large areas but yields less \\ndesirable cosmetic outcomes at the donor site.  \\n• For patients with focal or segmental vitiligo, Autologous Melanocyte \\nSuspension Transplant is an appropriate alternative to tissue grafting. \\n7. Depigmentation \\n• Depigmentation is the treatment of choice for patients who fail \\nrepigmentation therapy or have extensive disease.  \\n• Topical agents that depigment normal skin include monobenzone (also called \\nmonobenzyl ether of hydroquinone, or MBEH) which induces melanocyte \\ndeath.  \\n• Depigmenting agents and laser therapy only provide temporary cosmetic \\nrelief.  \\n8. Camouflage \\nCamouflage creates a cosmetically pleasing appearance and should be \\nrecommended to patients at all stages of treatment.

The SFDA registered topical formulation strength is at 1% which \\nis not appropriate for patient use; it has to be diluted to 0.1% by a compounding \\npharmacist. The regimen is as follows: 20 to 30 minutes after application of an even \\nlayer of Psoralen, the skin is exposed to UVA radiation, initially at 0.25 to 0.5 J/cm2. \\nTwo to three times a week, exposure time is increased in small steps (15-30 seconds) \\nup to a maximum of 10 minutes. Then, a marginally higher strength of topical \\npsoralen preparation is prescribed and the same time intervals are followed. This \\nprocedure is repeated until a dosage and exposure time are attained that produce \\nerythema but not burning. The use of Methoxsalen is limited by the heightened risk \\nof developing malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and \\ncataract. \\n2.5 Other Drugs \\n2.5.1 Ruxolitinib (Opzelura®) \\nTopical Ruxolitinib was approved by the FDA in July of 2022 and by the EMA in April \\nof 2023. It is indicated for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and \\npediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Topical Ruxolitinib is applied as a thin \\nlayer twice daily to affected areas of up to 10% body surface area.

It tells you \\nwhat it is, what causes it, what can be done \\nabout it and where you can find out more \\nabout it.  \\nWHAT IS ACNE? \\nAcne is a very common skin condition. It is \\nidentified by the presence of blackheads and \\nwhiteheads (comedones) and pus-filled spots \\n(pustules). Acne ranges from a few spots on \\nthe face, neck, back and chest, to a more \\nsevere problem with solid painful lumps \\nunder the skin. It may cause scarring. Acne \\nusually starts during puberty. Occasionally, \\nyoung children develop blackheads and/or \\npustules on the cheeks or nose. \\nMost people will experience some form of \\nacne during their lifetime. In most cases, acne \\ngoes away by the early to mid-twenties. In \\nother cases, it can go on for longer. Acne can \\nalso develop for the first time in people in \\ntheir late twenties and beyond. \\nWHAT CAUSES ACNE? \\nAcne is caused by a combination of factors.  \\n• Sebaceous (oil-producing) glands are \\ntiny glands found near the surface of \\nthe skin and are affected by our \\nhormones. In acne, the glands are \\nparticularly sensitive, even when these \\nhormones are at normal levels. This \\ncauses the glands to produce too \\nmuch oil (sebum).  \\n• At the same time, the lining of the \\npores (the small holes in the skin’s \\nsurface) becomes thickened and dead \\nskin cells build up and block the pores. \\n \\n• The mixture of the oil and dead skin \\ncells plugging the pores produces \\nblackheads and whiteheads.  \\n• Harmless bacteria that live on \\neveryone’s skin usually cause no \\nproblems. However, in acne, the build-\\nup of oil creates an ideal environment \\nfor the bacteria to multiply and cause \\ninflammation. This leads to the \\nformation of red, swollen or pus-filled \\nspots. (papules, pustules, nodules or \\ncysts).  \\n• Sometimes acne can be caused or \\nmade worse by excess hormones. This \\nmay occur in women in a condition \\ncalled polycystic ovary syndrome \\n(PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal imbalance \\nthat causes irregular periods, unusual \\nhair growth and hair thinning.  \\n• Acne can also be due to certain \\nhormonal contraceptive preparations \\nor high-dose steroids. Some tablets \\ntaken by bodybuilders contain \\nhormones (anabolic steroids) that can \\ntrigger acne. \\n• Occasionally, other types of \\nmedications can make acne worse. If \\nyou develop acne or it suddenly gets \\nworse, it would be worth discussing \\nthis with your healthcare professional. \\n• Oily skin care products, greasy \\nmoisturisers and hair products, or \\ncontact with oily substances at work, \\ncan also cause or worsen acne. Skin \\npicking can also make acne worse and \\ncause scarring. \\nThere is not enough evidence to support \\nspecific diets for treating acne. However, a \\nhealthy, well-balanced diet is advisable. For \\nfurther information, see'),\n",

It is likely that a combination of \\ngenetic, hormonal and lifestyle factors (such \\nas stress, skincare products, smoking, etc.) act \\nin combination to cause most acne. \\nWHAT DOES ACNE LOOK LIKE AND WHAT \\nDOES IT FEEL LIKE? \\nAcne is a mixture of the following: oily skin, \\nblackheads, whiteheads, red spots and pus-\\nfilled pimples. Occasionally, larger, deeper \\nbumps (known as nodules) or cysts (which \\nresemble boils) may develop. Affected skin \\nmay feel hot, painful and be tender to touch.  \\nAcne can leave scars or marks on the skin, \\nparticularly in the presence of nodules and \\ncysts. These may be raised and lumpy (known \\nas hypertrophic or keloid scars) or indented \\n(known as pitted or atrophic scars). Acne can \\nalso leave discolouration which may be red, \\nhyperpigmented (darker than your usual skin \\ncolour) or hypopigmented (lighter than your \\nnormal skin colour).  \\nNot all spots are acne, so if there is \\nsomething unusual about the rash it is \\nadvisable to consult your healthcare \\nprofessional. \\nOne important aspect of being affected by \\nacne that is not discussed often is its impact \\non mental health. Acne can significantly affect \\nan individual’s psychological well-being. This \\nmay lead to low self-esteem, lack of \\nconfidence, negative body image \\n(appearance-related concerns), anxiety and \\ndepression. Severe acne has been associated \\nwith suicidal behaviour. It is important to \\nrecognise the impact acne may have on how \\nyou feel. If required, speak with your \\nhealthcare professional about available \\nsupport.  \\nHOW IS ACNE DIAGNOSED? \\nA healthcare professional can diagnose acne \\nduring a skin examination. They do not \\nusually need to run any diagnostic tests as it \\nis easily recognised by the type of spots and \\nby their distribution on the face, neck, chest \\nor back.  \\nCAN ACNE BE CURED? \\nAt present, there is no ‘cure’ for acne. \\nTreatments can be very effective, preventing \\nthe formation of new spots and reducing \\nscarring. \\nHOW CAN ACNE BE TREATED? \\nThe first step is to use skincare products \\nsuitable for blemish-prone skin. These may \\nbe labelled as ‘non-comedogenic’ or ‘oil-free’.  \\nActive topical treatments (those applied \\ndirectly to the skin) can be bought over the \\ncounter without a prescription. These include \\nbenzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid and \\nnicotinamide. You should speak to your \\npharmacist for advice about these. Most \\ntreatments take 2 to 4 months to produce \\ntheir full effect. \\nIf you have acne but have had no success \\nwith over-the-counter products, then it is \\nadvisable to visit your healthcare \\nprofessional.  \\nAcne treatments fall into the following \\ncategories: \\n• Topical treatments, i.e. those that are \\napplied directly to the skin  \\n• Oral antibiotics, i.e. tablets taken by \\nmouth \\n• Oral contraceptive pills  \\n• Isotretinoin capsules \\n• Spironolactone tablets  \\n• Other treatments  \\nTopical treatments \\nThese are usually the first choice for those \\nwith mild to moderate acne. There is a variety \\nof active anti-acne agents. These include \\nbenzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics (e.g. \\nerythromycin, tetracycline and clindamycin), \\ntopical retinoids (e.g. tretinoin, isotretinoin \\nand adapalene), azelaic acid and nicotinamide \\n(also known as niacinamide). They should be \\napplied to the areas of your skin that are \\naffected by acne and not just to individual'),\n",

Usually, this is done every night or \\ntwice daily, depending on the treatment.  \\nSome topical treatments can be irritating to \\nthe skin. It may be advised that the treatment \\nis tested on a small area of affected skin for a \\nfew applications before being applied to the \\nentire affected area. It may also be \\nrecommended that you gradually increase \\nhow often you use the treatment, for \\nexample using it once or twice weekly. This \\ncould lead to regular daily use, if it is \\ntolerated. Consult your healthcare \\nprofessional if the treatment continues to \\ncause irritation of the skin despite reducing \\nthe number of times it is applied. \\nSome topical treatments, such as retinoids \\ncan lead to the acne getting worse for a few \\nweeks before it gets better. \\nOral antibiotic treatment  \\nYour healthcare professional may \\nrecommend a course of antibiotic tablets, \\nusually erythromycin or a type of tetracycline. \\nWhenever possible, these should be taken at \\nthe same time as using topical treatments. It \\ncould improve your acne and help prevent \\nyour body getting used to the antibiotics. \\nAntibiotics need to be taken for at least 12 \\nweeks and are usually continued until there is \\nno further improvement. A course of \\nantibiotics is usually given for 3 to 6 months. \\nThey should not normally be continued for \\nmore than 6 months due to concerns about \\nantibiotic resistance. Some antibiotics should \\nnot be taken with food or can make your skin \\nmore sensitive to the sun, so read the \\ninstructions carefully. It is also essential to let \\nyour doctor know if you are planning a \\npregnancy as some antibiotics cannot be \\ntaken if you are pregnant. \\nOral contraceptive treatments \\nOral combined contraceptive pills containing \\ncyproterone acetate may be helpful in \\nwomen with hormone imbalances, who are \\naffected by acne. These are usually used for \\npeople with PCOS. These tablets carry a small \\nrisk of blood clots so you must tell your \\ndoctor if you have any past history of these. \\nThis is a greater risk for people who smoke, \\nare overweight or have others in the family \\nwho have had blood clots. \\nIsotretinoin \\nIsotretinoin is a highly effective treatment for \\nsevere acne. The improvements can be long-\\nlasting in those who complete a course of \\ntreatment. However, it has the potential to \\ncause some serious side effects. Isotretinoin \\ncan be prescribed only under the supervision \\nof a dermatology healthcare professional. \\nMost courses of isotretinoin last for around 6 \\nmonths. During this time, the skin usually \\nbecomes dry, particularly around the lips. \\nRegular application of a lip balm can be \\nhelpful. Often, acne becomes a little worse for \\na few weeks before improvement occurs. The \\nimprovement is progressive throughout the \\ncourse of treatment, so do not be \\ndisappointed if progress seems slow. \\nIsotretinoin can harm an unborn child. The \\ngovernment’s medicine safety agency (MHRA) \\nhas strict rules for prescribing this medicine. \\nPeople who are able to get pregnant must \\nenrol in a pregnancy prevention programme \\n(PPP). They need to have a negative \\npregnancy test before starting treatment. It is \\nvery important to use reliable contraception \\nwhilst taking isotretinoin.  \\nUsually, pregnancy tests will be repeated \\nevery month during treatment. This is \\nrequired if you are using a contraceptive pill \\n(or contraceptive injection) plus a barrier \\nmethod of contraception. Another pregnancy \\ntest is also required 1 month after completing \\nthe course of treatment.  \\nPregnancy tests may be done less frequently \\nif you are using a highly effective, ‘user \\nindependent’ method of contraception. These \\ninclude contraceptive implants, coils (IUD) or \\nintra-uterine systems (IUS). ‘User \\nindependent’ means that you do not have to \\nremember to take the contraception.  \\nContraception must be used for at least 4 \\nweeks before treatment, during treatment, \\nand for at least four weeks after. \\nFollowing a report by the Commission on \\nHuman Medicines’ Isotretinoin Expert \\nWorking Group in April 2023, concerns were'),\n",

We know that people affected by \\nacne are more likely to experience anxiety \\nand depression than people who are not \\naffected. This is because acne may affect self-\\nconfidence and make people distressed \\nabout the way they look. \\nSeveral studies have shown that isotretinoin \\ncan improve negative mood changes caused \\nby acne. \\nYou should tell your healthcare professional if \\nyou have any personal or family history of low \\nmood, depression or other mental health \\ncondition when considering isotretinoin \\ntherapy. You may be asked to see a mental \\nhealthcare professional before any treatment \\nis commenced, to determine if it is safe for \\nyou to proceed. Letting close friends and \\nfamily know about your treatment provides \\nan opportunity for them to notice any \\nchanges in your mood. If this is the case, you \\nshould report these to your doctor without \\ndelay. \\nThere are very rare reports of people having \\nsexual function problems with isotretinoin. \\nWe do not know how often these may occur. \\nWe know that problems with sexual function \\ncan be related to mental health issues. Other \\nmedication (such as antidepressants), which \\nmay be taken at the same time as \\nisotretinoin, may also cause these. \\nThere are some individual reports of patients \\nexperiencing a lack of interest in sex (low \\nlibido), vaginal dryness, difficulty \\ngetting/keeping an erection and reduced \\nsensation in the genitals. \\nRarely, men have reported breast tissue \\ndevelopment (gynaecomastia). \\nSome people have reported that the \\nproblems have continued after stopping \\ntreatment. \\nIf you have problems with sexual function, \\ndiscuss with your dermatology healthcare \\nprofessional before taking isotretinoin. \\nFurther information about isotretinoin can be \\nfound in the section \"Where can I find more \\ninformation about acne?\". \\nSpironolactone \\nSpironolactone is a drug usually prescribed \\nfor heart problems, high blood pressure and \\nfluid retention. It also has hormonal effects by \\nblocking the action of androgens (male \\nhormones), that are normally produced in low \\nlevels by all women. Women affected by acne \\noften have raised levels of androgens or \\nincreased sensitivity to normal levels of \\nandrogens. Some of these women will have \\nPCOS. \\nFor this reason, spironolactone is used “off-\\nlicence” to treat acne in women. An \\nunlicensed drug is one that has not been \\nawarded a Market Authorisation by the UK \\nMedicines Healthcare Products Regulatory \\nAgency (MHRA). Drug licences are awarded \\nfollowing a rigorous process of evaluation by \\nthe MHRA following an application by a \\npharmaceutical company. Once awarded, the \\nlicensed drug can then be marketed and sold \\nin the UK. In the absence of a licence, the \\ndrug may still be prescribed in the UK, \\nprovided there is funding available locally to \\npay for it. Additionally, there must be a clear \\nbody of evidence to confirm that the drug is \\neffective for the condition in question and \\nthat safety concerns have been adequately \\naddressed. \\nTherefore, the off-licence use of \\nspironolactone means that the treatment has \\nnot been authorised to specifically treat acne \\nin the UK by the MHRA. However, there is \\nevidence that it is effective and safe to treat \\nacne. Healthcare professionals can therefore \\nprescribe it when they think that it is \\nnecessary. \\nOther treatments \\nThere are many forms of light and laser \\ntherapy for inflammatory acne.

Skin \\ncamouflage is an inexpensive and effective \\nmethod for disguising changes in the \\npigmentation of the skin which can \\nsometimes remain after acne has been \\ntreated. \\nSELF-CARE (WHAT CAN I DO?) \\n• Try not to pick or squeeze your spots \\nas this usually aggravates them and \\nmay cause scarring and infection. \\n• If your self-confidence has been \\naffected by acne or if you are feeling \\ndistressed, it is important to reach out \\nto others for support. This includes \\nfriends, family members and support \\ngroups. You may also be able to \\naccess a counsellor through school, \\nuniversity or work.  \\n• Let your healthcare professional know \\nif being affected by acne is making you \\nhave low moods, feel depressed or \\nanxious. They will be able to speak \\nwith you about how you are feeling \\nand help you to form a treatment plan. \\nThis may involve help from other \\nspecialists, such as psychologists or \\npsychiatrists, if necessary.  \\n• However, you are affected by acne, it is \\nimportant to take action to control it \\nas soon as it appears. This helps to \\navoid permanent scarring.

A \\npharmacist will be able to advise you. \\n• Expect to use your treatments for at \\nleast 12 weeks before you see much \\nimprovement.

It is a disorder of the \\npilosebaceous unit (hair follicle and associated oil gland).  Factors that contribute to acne \\nformation include increased sebum (a substance made up of oil and wax that functions to \\nprotect the skin), increased build-up of material in the hair follicle, increased levels of \\nCutibacterium acnes (a bacteria that is commonly present on the skin in low numbers), and \\ninflammation.  Clinically, there are three categories of acne including comedonal \\n(whiteheads and blackheads), inflammatory (red bumps), and nodular (large, painful \\ncysts). \\nHormones signal oil glands in the skin to increase their production of sebum.  A plug of \\nsebum and keratin (a protein that helps maintain the structure of the skin, hair, and nails) \\nforms and blocks the opening of the hair follicle creating whiteheads and blackheads.  The \\nincreased sebum supports increased concentrations of P. acnes.  This leads to further \\nblockage of the hair follicle opening and to increased inflammation.  Ultimately the hair \\nfollicle can rupture, resulting in large, painful nodules.  Insulin also contributes to the \\nformation of acne.  Insulin and insulin-like growth factor act by directly increasing the \\nactivity of the oil gland, as well as by indirectly increasing the levels of other hormones that \\nstimulate the oil gland including insulin-like growth factor and androgens. \\n \\nFigure 1. Pathophysiology of Acne'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Acne.pdf'}, page_content='Acne \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 2 of 8 \\nThere are many factors to take into account when deciding on a treatment plan: the type of \\nacne, the severity of acne, whether there is scarring, what has been tried in the past, and \\nthe psychological impact should all be assessed.  In girls and women, information about \\nmenstrual history (specifically regularity, duration, and quantity of bleeding) and signs of \\nhormonal abnormalities (excessive facial hair, insulin resistance) can also be helpful. \\nTREATMENT \\nSKIN CARE \\nThe first step to managing acne is to adhere to gentle skin care practices.  The skin should \\nbe rinsed gently with warm water once or twice a day.  Washcloths or other abrasive \\nmaterials should be avoided, and only gentle, nonsoap-based cleansers should be used.  \\nDetergent-based soaps, toners, and astringents further dry and irritate the skin.  While they \\ndo remove oil and sebum from the surface of the skin, they do not alter sebum production \\nwithin the oil gland.  Ultimately, overly dry skin signals the pilosebaceous units to make \\nmore oil in order to adequately protect the skin.  Moisturizers can help acne, but it is \\nimportant to make sure any moisturizers or cosmetics are not oil based and are labeled \\nnoncomedogenic. \\nThe impulse to pick and squeeze acne lesions is common and can be difficult to overcome.  \\nThese practices can lead to immediate gratification, but ultimately slow down the \\ndisappearance of specific acne lesions.  These practices also result in tissue injury, which \\ncreates more inflammation and potential scarring that is very difficult, if not impossible, to \\nreverse. \\nFOOD & DRINK \\nHealthy dietary choices are important for overall health.  Anti-inflammatory or \\nMediterranean-style dietary approaches have been found to enhance many aspects of \\nhealth—especially in the setting of inflammatory diseases.  Acne is an inflammatory \\ncondition and will likely improve when dietary choices better align with foods that inhibit \\nrather than promote inflammation.[1]  In particular, low glycemic index/low glycemic load \\ndiets have been shown to improve acne in clinical trials.[2]  More information about these \\ndietary approaches can be found in the “Food and Drink,” Whole Health overview. \\nAvoiding or limiting all forms of dairy may be beneficial.  Dairy intake has been linked to \\nincreased risk and severity of acne.  This is likely in part due to stimulating increased levels \\nof insulin-like growth factor.[3]  Limiting the intake of foods high in added hormones (such \\nas meat and dairy) may also be helpful since these foods may alter hormonal balances and \\nmay lead to overstimulation of the oil gland.  \\nThere is also evidence that increasing plants in the diet can help treat acne.  We know that \\nplants are full of prebiotics—compounds that are either indigestible or partially digestible \\nby humans, which can be metabolized by the microbiome in our guts.  Basically, plants help \\nfeed the gut microbiome and help keep it healthy. Maintaining a healthy balance of'),\n",

Other mechanism \\nthat have been proposed for benefits of diets rich in plants for patients with acne include \\nmodulation of hormones, normalization of blood sugar and insulin sensitivity and anti-\\ninflammatory benefits.[4]\\n   \\nSUPPLEMENTS \\nNote: Please refer to the Passport to Whole Health, Chapter 15 on Dietary Supplements \\nfor more information about how to determine whether or not a specific supplement is \\nappropriate for a given individual.  Supplements are not regulated with the same \\ndegree of oversight as medications, and it is important that clinicians keep this in mind.  \\nProducts vary greatly in terms of accuracy of labeling, presence of adulterants, and the \\nlegitimacy of claims made by the manufacturer. \\nOMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS \\nOmega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease the production of inflammatory \\ncompounds and of the hormones important in acne formation.[5]  Additionally, groups of \\npeople who consume high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids have less acne than groups of \\npeople who have lower levels of this nutrient. Ideally, omega-3 fatty acids should come \\nfrom foods such as fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, and sardines), flaxseeds, and walnuts.  \\nWhen that is not possible, supplements can be helpful.  The omega-3s in flax are not as \\npotent as those from fish oil; refer to the Whole Health overview “Food and Drink” for \\ndetails. \\nDose:[6] \\n• 1tbsp of flax oil for every 100 lb daily \\n• 1-2 tbsp of ground flaxseeds daily  \\n• 1-2 gm of fish oil capsules twice daily \\nBREWER’S YEAST \\nBrewer’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is commonly used to treat acne in Eastern \\nEurope.  It has a high concentration of chromium picolinate, which has been shown to \\nimprove glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (thereby reducing insulin and insulin-like \\nproteins in the blood stream).  \\nOne study looked at brewer’s yeast supplementation in \\npeople with acne and found significant improvement in 80% of those taking the \\nsupplement.[7]  It is generally quite safe, but due to high levels of tyramine, it can cause \\nheadaches in people sensitive to this compound and can cause higher blood pressures in \\npeople who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.  \\nBrewer’s yeast may also worsen \\nCrohn’s disease.[8]  Oral antifungal medications may decrease the effectiveness of the \\nyeast.  \\n• Dose:[7] 2 gm of dried brewer’s yeast three times a day'),\n",

Consider a product that \\ncontains both Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains and at least 10 billion \\ncolony forming units (CFUs). \\nVITAMINS AND MINERALS \\nStudies have found that vitamin A, vitamin E, and/or zinc are decreased in patients with \\nacne.  \\nZinc. Zinc is a cofactor in many reactions important in maintaining skin health and immune \\nfunction. It has anti-inflammatory properties as well as inhibitory effects on C. acnes. Many \\nstudies show that supplementation can improve acne. It is likely that the formulation of \\nzinc is important, and it appears that effervescent preparations of zinc, zinc picolonate, and \\nmethionine-bound zinc are more bioactive than other formulations such as zinc gluconate.  \\n• Dose:[12] 30 mg elemental zinc a day* \\n*At doses higher than 30 mg a day, zinc can induce a copper deficiency; 2 mg of copper \\nshould be added for every additional 30 mg of elemental zinc. \\nFood sources:  oysters, beef, poultry (dark meat), pork, beans, nuts \\nVitamin A. Vitamin A modulates the immune system and decreases keratinization of the \\nhair follicle.  However, studies looking at the effectiveness of preformed vitamin A \\nsupplementation in acne have found that only very high doses effectively improve acne.  \\nThese doses were well above the upper limit of safety set by the Recommended Daily \\nAllowance (RDA), and most participants had significant side effects consistent with \\nhypervitaminosis A.

It tells you what these conditions are, what they are caused by, what can \\nbe done about them, and where you can find out more about them. \\n  \\nWhat are cellulitis and erysipelas? \\n  \\nErysipelas and cellulitis are common infections of the skin. Erysipelas is a superficial \\ninfection, affecting the upper layers of the skin, while cellulitis affects the deeper \\ntissues. They can overlap, so it is not always possible to make a definite diagnosis \\nbetween the two.   \\n  \\nWhat causes cellulitis and erysipelas? \\n  \\nBacteria (germs) get through a break in the skin. This break can be very small, such \\nas from a scratch, ins ect bite or injection, or from another skin disease such as \\nathlete’s foot , eczema or a leg ulcer. The body’s immune system tries to stop the \\nbacteria spreading. If this is not successful, an infection will develop. \\n  \\nErysipelas is usually caused by bacter ia called streptococci. Cellulitis is also often \\ncaused by streptococci, but many other bacteria may be involved , such as \\nstaphylococci. \\n \\nWho gets cellulitis or erysipelas? \\n  \\nAnybody can get cellulitis or erysipelas, and once you’ve had it, you are more li kely \\nto get it again in the same part of the body . There are also some conditions which \\nmake cellulitis and erysipelas more likely:'),\n",

This may \\nstart a few hours or a day before the skin changes become visible. The affected skin \\ncan become painful, swollen, firm, warm, and redder, purple or darker in colour, and \\nblisters may form. The nearest lymph  glands may become swollen and tender. The \\narea of affected skin may gradually get larger .

They are different from \\nimpetigo, which is a superficial infection and can be passed to other people.  \\n \\nCan cellulitis and erysipelas be cured?  \\n  \\nYes, and treatment with antibiotics at an early stage is important to prevent the \\nspread of infection and the complications listed above.  \\n  \\nWhat tests are needed for cellulitis and erysipelas?  \\n \\nUncomplicated cellulitis in a healthy patient does not require a blood test. Some \\npeople will have a blood test and swab of the affected area of skin .

The antibiotic given to you will depend \\non your local trusts antimicrobial guidelines. If the condition is not improving, higher \\ndoses and longer courses may be required. More severe cellulitis and erysipelas are \\nlikely to need antibiotic injections or infusions in hospital.  \\n \\nMost people are treated with a form of penicillin called flucloxacillin, so it is extremely \\nimportant that you tell your doctor if you are allergic to penicillin.  \\n \\nAs long as the affected area is swollen  and hot, it should be rested. In cellulitis or \\nerysipelas of the leg, the foot should be rested higher than the hip to allow gravity to \\nreduce the swelling. \\n \\nCellulitis is usually painful and your doctor will advise about pain killers such as \\nparacetamol tablets. \\n \\nAs the pain and infection settles down, the compression bandaging or stockings of \\nthe leg may be started, when comfortable, to reduce the swelling. Any longer term \\nleg swelling after the skin infection has settled will usually be treated with \\ncompression stockings to reduce the risk of future infections. \\n \\nFailure to improve to appropriate treatment may lead your doctor to seek a specialist \\nopinion as sometimes this condition can mimic others.  \\n  \\nIt is important that any breaks in the skin, for exa mple due to athlete’s foot or \\neczema, are treated to prevent repeated episodes of cellulitis. Your doctor may \\nprescribe topical medication (in a cream) for this.   It is important to regularly check \\nthe skin in the future for breaks or other skin problems as these could lead to future \\ncellulitis episodes. \\n  \\nIf there are repeated episodes of cellulitis or erysipelas, the doctor may suggest \\nlong-term preventative antibiotic treatment. \\n  \\nSelf Care (What can I do?) \\n  \\n\\uf0b7 See your doctor as early as possible if you think you are getting another \\nattack of erysipelas or cellulitis.

Starting with scientific and epidemiological facts, moving \\nthrough clinical features and management, medical students are given a structure that \\nenables them to organise learning effectively. The content remains focused on learning at \\nthe undergraduate stage of the medical education spectrum: a vital foundation for \\npostgraduate training in dermatology.   \\n \\nThe UK population has become increasingly diverse over the last few decades, it is therefore \\nnecessary to update the handbook to highlight tips for assessment, variation in presentation \\nin common and important skin conditions (e.g. common pigmentary disorders) that reflect \\nthe spectrum of cutaneous diversity junior clinicians will encounter in their practice.

Within \\nthe treatment landscape, three broad classes of options exist, the choice of which \\nis very personal to each person. While one person may prefer oral medication, \\nanother might instead opt for topical creams, or even non-pharmacological \\ntreatment options (e.g. ultraviolet (UV) therapy).

This leaflet has been written to \\nprovide you with an overview of psoriasis. It \\ntells you what psoriasis is, what causes it, \\nwhat can be done about it, and where you \\ncan find out more about it. The two other \\nleaflets (Topical treatments for psoriasis \\nand Treatment of moderate and severe \\npsoriasis) give more details about the \\ndifferent types of treatment. \\nWHAT IS PSORIASIS? \\nPsoriasis is a common, long term skin \\ncondition that comes and goes throughout \\nyour lifetime. It happens due to over-activity \\nof the immune system. \\nPsoriasis is not infectious; therefore, you \\ncannot catch it from someone else. It does \\nnot scar the skin, although sometimes it can \\ncause temporary changes of skin colour. \\nAlthough psoriasis is a long-term condition \\nthere are many effective treatments \\navailable to keep it under good control. \\nPsoriasis affects about 1 in 50 people. It \\nmay occur at any age from puberty \\nonwards, but rarely can affect younger \\nchildren.  \\nPsoriasis affects the skin and may affect the \\nnails. It is also associated with a condition \\ncalled psoriatic arthritis in about 1 in 5 \\npeople. Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory \\ncondition of the joints which can cause pain \\nand sometimes joint damage. The pain can \\nbe quite variable but is typically worse in \\nthe morning and after rest periods. It may \\nbe associated with hot and swollen joints. \\nIndividuals may also report stiffness in the \\nlower back. It is important to identify any \\npossible joint pain early to help alleviate the \\nsymptoms and reduce long-term \\ncomplications associated with joint \\nsymptoms. This should be managed by a \\nrheumatologist who works with your \\ndermatologist and/or your GP. \\nPsoriasis is considered to be one of a \\nnumber of immune-mediated inflammatory \\ndiseases (IMID). Other IMIDs include \\nankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and \\ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  \\nPeople affected by psoriasis and other \\nIMIDs may also have a higher risk of \\nexperiencing other health problems. These \\ncan include things like feeling anxious or \\ndepressed, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, \\nobesity, blood clots, high cholesterol, and \\nhigh blood pressure. While we do not fully \\nunderstand why these conditions are \\nconnected, scientists are actively studying \\nthis relationship.  \\nUnderstanding this connection can help \\nindividuals take steps to identify and \\naddress these concerns. It is important to \\nmake informed choices about your lifestyle \\nand consider using health screening \\nservices provided by your doctor (GP). This \\nway, you can take proactive measures to \\nmanage your overall health and well-being. \\nWHAT CAUSES PSORIASIS? \\nThe cause of psoriasis is unknown. It is \\nbelieved that both genetic and \\nenvironmental factors play a role in its \\ndevelopment. It is thought that something \\ntriggers the immune system making it more \\nactive. This then leads to a long-lasting \\n(chronic) inflammation that causes the skin \\ncells to reproduce too quickly.'),\n",

For many people, \\npsoriasis can get better with exposure to \\nUV light (a type of light that comes from the \\nsun and some artificial sources such as \\nsunbeds). However, for others, UV light can \\nworsen psoriasis. Changes in the body, \\nsuch as pregnancy, can make psoriasis \\nbetter, but not always. \\nThe onset and severity of psoriasis has also \\nbeen linked to alcohol consumption, being \\noverweight, smoking, and stress. All of these \\nfactors are known to cause a type of mild \\n(low-grade) inflammation in the body. \\nHowever, not everyone who smokes, drinks \\nalcohol or is overweight will develop \\npsoriasis. \\nWe do not fully understand why these \\ntriggers lead to psoriasis, and it may vary \\nfrom person to person. \\nIS PSORIASIS HEREDITARY? \\nYes, there is a strong family link to psoriasis. \\nIf you have a family member affected by \\npsoriasis, you are more likely to be affected \\nby it too, due to shared genes. The way \\npsoriasis is inherited is complex and not \\ncompletely understood. \\nWHAT DOES PSORIASIS LOOK AND FEEL \\nLIKE? \\n• The skin of a person affected by \\npsoriasis can appear pink, red, or \\ndarker, but in richly pigmented skin, \\nthis may not be visible. The skin also \\nappears scaly – scales are typically of \\nsilvery colour. \\n• The flakes and scales can be visible on \\ndark coloured clothing and may cause \\nanxiety. Many people with psoriasis \\nprefer to avoid dark clothing so that \\nthe flakes  are not obvious. \\n• Psoriasis may affect any part of the \\nbody, but commonly affected areas \\nare the outside surface of the elbow \\nand knee, belly button (umbilicus) and \\nscalp. \\n• Psoriasis can be itchy and painful. \\nCertain sites such as the scalp, lower \\nlegs and groin can be particularly \\nitchy. If psoriasis affects the hands and \\nfeet, painful fissures (cracks) can \\ndevelop, and these can affect use of \\nthe hands and walking. Severe \\npsoriasis on the body can also \\ndevelop cracks which are painful and \\ncan bleed.  \\n• Psoriasis can affect the nails which \\nmay be painful and can cause lifting of \\nthe nail, pitting of the nail or \\ndisfigurement of the nail. These \\nchanges can be painful and may affect \\ndexterity – for example, they can limit \\nthe ability to do simple tasks, such as \\ndoing buttons up or picking small \\nobject up; they also can catch on \\nclothing when getting dressed \\n• When psoriasis affects certain areas of \\nthe body, quality of life may be very \\nsignificantly impacted. These high \\nimpact sites include hands, face, scalp \\ngenitals and feet. \\n• Psoriatic arthritis produces pain, \\nswelling and stiffness in one or more \\njoints, particularly in the morning. It \\ncan also affect connective tissue, \\nligaments and tendons. You must \\nspeak with your doctor if you need a \\nreferral to a rheumatologist. \\n \\nMany people have just a few plaques \\nbut some individuals with moderate to \\nsevere psoriasis may have several \\nplaques covering large areas of their \\nbody.  \\nSeveral patterns of psoriasis are \\nrecognised: \\n• Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most \\ncommon type of psoriasis. Plaques \\n(circular, scaly skin lesions) of psoriasis \\nare usually present on the knees, \\nelbows, trunk, scalp, behind ears and'),\n",

It can be caused \\nby bacteria called streptococcus which \\ncan cause throat infections. \\n• Palmoplantar psoriasis is psoriasis \\naffecting the palms and soles. \\nPsoriasis may appear at other sites \\ntoo. \\n• Pustular psoriasis is rare type of \\npsoriasis where the plaques on the \\ntrunk and limbs are studded with tiny \\nyellow pus filled spots. It can be \\nlocalised or generalised and can flare \\nrapidly necessitating hospital \\nadmission for treatment. \\n• Flexural psoriasis affects the skin folds \\n(armpits and groin) and may be seen \\nalongside chronic plaque psoriasis or \\nin isolation. \\n• Erythrodermic psoriasis is a very \\nsevere form of psoriasis which affects \\nnearly all of the skin and can \\nsometimes require hospital admission \\nfor treatment. \\nNail psoriasis is present in about half of \\npeople with psoriasis. The features of nail \\npsoriasis are: \\n• Pitting (indentations) and ridging of \\nthe surface of the nail \\n• Salmon pink areas of discolouration \\nunder the nail \\n• Lifting of the nails, and \\n• Thickening and yellowing of the nails \\n• Complete nail destruction. \\nHOW WILL PSORIASIS BE DIAGNOSED?  \\nPsoriasis is usually diagnosed on the \\nappearance and distribution of the \\nplaques. Skin biopsy is rarely used. \\nPsoriatic arthritis is usually diagnosed by a \\nrheumatologist, but your dermatologist or \\nGP may ask you if you have any joint \\nsymptoms or ask you to complete a \\nscreening questionnaire. \\nIn most people, skin psoriasis develops first. \\nA small number of people, psoriasis can \\npresent with nail involvement only. Similarly, \\nsome people develop joint symptoms first \\nbefore having skin symptoms. In most \\ncases, it usually takes few years before you \\ndevelop nail or joint symptoms. \\nHOW IS PSORIASIS ASSESSED? \\nPsoriasis should be assessed at diagnosis, \\nbefore your first referral to a specialist, \\nevery time you see a specialist and to \\nassess your response to treatment. \\nPsoriasis may be assessed by your doctors \\nusing a variety of scores which measure the \\nseverity in your skin and joints, how \\npsoriasis is affecting your mood and your \\nactivities of daily living and whether you are \\nat risk of heart disease.  \\nThese scores include the PASI (Psoriasis \\nArea and Severity Index) and DLQI \\n(Dermatology Life Quality Index – a score \\nthat measures the impact of psoriasis on \\nyour quality of life). This assessment will be \\npart of your specialist reviews and it will \\nhelp monitor the effects of treatment on \\nfurther or follow up visits.  \\nCAN PSORIASIS BE CURED? \\nThere is no cure for psoriasis. However, \\nthere are several effective treatments \\navailable to keep psoriasis well controlled. \\nSpontaneous (or sudden, unexpected) \\nclearance of psoriasis may occur in some \\npeople. \\nHOW CAN PSORIASIS BE TREATED? \\nTreatment of psoriasis depends upon your \\nindividual circumstances. Treatment \\napplied to the surface of your skin (topical \\ntreatment) is sufficient alone in most \\npeople.

This fact sheet \\nwill give you information on staying safe in the sun so that you can enjoy yourself outside. You will find \\nsections on UVA and UVB rays, sunscreen, top tips for applying sunscreen, and vitamin D.   \\nOur top sun safety tips \\nSun safety doesn’t have to mean total sun avoidance. Instead, we recommend three simple steps to keep \\nsafe in the sun at home or abroad. These will keep you safe from sunburn and reduce your risk of skin \\ncancer in the future. \\n \\n \\nUVA and UVB \\nSun damage is caused by ultraviolet rays from the sun, known as UV rays. Two types of UV rays can \\npenetrate the Earth’s atmosphere, these are called UVA rays and UVB rays. Both types of UV rays are \\nlinked to skin ageing and skin cancer and UVB rays are largely responsible for sunburn. \\nWhen it comes to choosing sunscreen products, it’s important to pick ones that offer both UVB protection \\nand UVA protection. UVB protection is indicated by the SPF (sun protection factor) while UVA protection is \\nindicated by the UVA logo or the UVA star system. With sunscreen this ‘broad -spectrum’ protection is \\nstandard, but other products such as moisturisers and lip balms which offer sun protection sometimes \\nonly offer UVB protection. For more information on sunscreen see our section on sunscreens below.  \\nUnderstanding UV levels \\nThis intensity of the sun’s UV rays changes throughout the day and the year. They tend to peak between \\n11am and 3pm during the summer months and between 10am and 2pm during the winter months. As \\nyou would expect, UV levels are at their highest on a clear day in mid-summer.  \\nUV levels are expressed using the UV index. Most weather apps and forecasts include a UV Index, and you \\ncan also check the UV Index on the Met Office website.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Sun-protection-fact-sheet.pdf'}, page_content=\"Members  bad.org.uk | Patient hub  skinhealthinfo.org.uk \\nA UV Index rating of 3 (medium on some weather forecast apps) or more is the point at which we \\nrecommend sun protection for people with white skin. In the UK, this is usually between April and \\nSeptember.  \\nFor people with black and brown skin, a UV index rating of 11+ (extremely high on some weather forecast \\napps) is the point at which we recommend sun protection. The maximum UV index in the UK is around 7, \\nso routine sun protection is usually unnecessary for people with these skin tones. However, there are  \\nimportant exceptions to this advice. Sun protection, even in the UK, is important for people with black or \\nbrown skin if:  \\n• You have a skin condition such as photosensitivity, vitiligo, or lupus which makes you more vulnerable \\nto sun damage \\n• If you have a high risk of skin cancer, especially if you are taking immunosuppressive treatments \\n(including organ transplant recipients), or if you are genetically pre-disposed to skin cancer  \\nIn some countries, the UV Index can be extreme and if you plan on spending a prolonged time outdoors \\nyou may wish to follow sun protection advice.  \\nSun exposure can also make hyperpigmentation (spots or patches of darker skin) more noticeable. If this \\nis a concern, follow sun protection advice for the affected area. \\nCheck the UV index forecast to ensure you don't get caught out. \\nMake use of the shade \\nShade is a great way to protect yourself from the sun while enjoying being outside but, depending on the \\nlevel of shade, you may also need to use other forms of protection.  \\nWhen we are outside in the summer, roughly half the UV we are exposed to  comes directly from the sun \\nand the other half is from UV rays scattered in the sky. This means you can sit in the shade and still be \\nexposed to these scattered UV rays.  \\nImagine being under a beach umbrella on a sunny day. Beach umbrellas only offer about 3 to 5 times \\nmore protection than no shade at all. In this instance, effective sun protection may also involve using \\nsunscreen and/or clothing.  \\nIf we wish to achieve a protection factor of 20 or higher from shade alone, we need to block not only \\ndirect sunlight but about 90% of the sky. If you find that hard to picture, this would be the equivalent to \\nthe level of shade provided by a woodland.  \\nProtective clothing – what do we mean? \\nClothing is very effective at protecting against UV from the sun. Importantly, you want good body coverage \\nand fabric which prevents UV radiation from reaching your skin.  \\nSeveral factors affect the UV protection provided by clothing. These include weave density, composition of \\nfibres, colour, thickness, and wetness. \\nStudies carried out on thousands of samples of summer clothing indicate that about two -thirds of \\nsamples offer protection equivalent to SPF 50 or higher with more than 95% providing more than 10 -fold \\nprotection.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Sun-protection-fact-sheet.pdf'}, page_content='Members  bad.org.uk | Patient hub  skinhealthinfo.org.uk \\nA hat, t-shirt, shorts and sunglasses would be considered good coverage if used with other forms of sun \\nprotection. \\nHats and sunglasses \\nHats protect the scalp, a common site for sun damage in balding men. They provide shade to parts of the \\nface, with the extent of shade depending on the hat design.  \\nA wide-brimmed hat, such as a Panama hat, offers the best type of protection. Baseball caps provide good \\nprotection to the nose but leave the ears, cheeks and neck unprotected. Legionnaire -style hats, with a flap \\nof fabric covering the neck and ears, are particularly effective at protecting these sites.  \\nSunglasses are important to wear in strong sunlight as they protect our eyes from UV damage  and protect \\nthe skin around the eyes which is often missed when applying sunscreen. Sunglasses that transmit 1% or \\nless of UVB and UVA are often labelled as UV400. \\nWhat do I need to know about sunscreen? \\n \\nTo get the most out of sunscreen, it’s helpful to understand how it works – what it does, and what it doesn’t \\ndo.  \\nMost sunscreens contain a mix of organic and inorganic chemicals. Organic chemicals work by absorbing \\nUV radiation, turning it into harmless warmth. Inorganic chemicals both absorb and scatter UV rays away \\nfrom the skin. \\nSunscreen can take many forms, including creams, milks, lotions, and sprays, among others. They come \\nlabelled with an SPF, which stands for Sun Protection Factor. We recommend you choose a sunscreen \\nwith an SPF of 30 or above. Your sunscreen should also have a UVA logo (see image below). This indicates \\nthat the sunscreen will protect you from UVA rays (see section on UVA rays above). SPF and UVA \\nprotection are linked, so a higher SPF sunscreen will have more UVA protection.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Sun-protection-fact-sheet.pdf'}, page_content='Members  bad.org.uk | Patient hub  skinhealthinfo.org.uk \\n \\nThe UVA logo: the letters UVA inside a circle \\nMost sunscreens sold in the UK use the Star Rating system (see image below) to indicate the product’s \\nUVA protection rating. With the star rating system the higher the number of stars, the more protection \\nyou’ll get from UVA rays. We recommend choosing products with 4 or 5-star protection.  \\n \\nStar Rating system for UVA protection in sunscreen: from 1 star (minimum) to 5 stars (ultra) \\n \\nAn important thing to remember is that the best sunscreen is the one you are happy to wear. It may take \\ntrial and error to find one you love. \\nHow long will sunscreens keep \\nSunscreens are mixtures of oil and water so will always tend towards separation. The time this takes \\ndepends on the quality of the formulation and can vary from just a few months to many years. Typically, \\nthe shelf life for sunscreens is 30 months.  \\nSunscreens should be stored in a cool, dry place, out of direct sunlight. Look for the ‘period after opening’ \\n(PAO) symbol on the labelling. The PAO symbol is a small picture of an opened jar with a number printed \\nwithin it. This number shows the number of months the product can be used after it has been opened.  \\nSPF in moisturisers \\nThe SPF in moisturisers is tested the same way as SPF in sunscreens. In theory, this means that a \\nmoisturiser with SPF 15 should provide you with the equivalent protection of SPF 15. In reality, the \\nprotection you receive is much lower.  \\nThis is for several reasons. Typically, moisturiser is applied more thinly than sunscreen. Thinner coverage \\nprovides a lower level of sun protection. In addition, most sunscreens are formulated to be rub -resistant \\nand water resistant, and to bind well with the skin – moisturisers are not. Finally, many moisturisers don’t \\nprotect against UVA rays.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Sun-protection-fact-sheet.pdf'}, page_content='Members  bad.org.uk | Patient hub  skinhealthinfo.org.uk \\nA moisturiser with an SPF will help protect you against small amounts of UV exposure, such as when you \\nwalk to the car or pop outside to hang out the washing, but sunscreen is better for longer, more \\ndeliberate UV exposure. \\nCan I use sunscreen on my baby? \\nThe best approach is to keep infants under 6 months out of direct sun and in the shade as much as \\npossible. This is especially important between the hours of 11 am and 3 pm when UV rays are most \\nintense.  \\nAvoid using sunscreen on babies younger than 6 months unless there is no other way to protect them \\nfrom the sun. Shade and clothing which covers the skin are better sun protection methods. \\nA few general safety tips for sun protection for babies:  \\n• Make sure your child wears loose-fitting clothing that covers the skin and keeps them cool, \\nincluding a sun hat \\n• If there is no other option, and you cannot keep your baby out of the sun, you can apply small \\namounts of high SPF sunscreen to small areas like cheeks and the back of their hands  \\n• Don’t forget that babies and children can easily overheat, which can be very dangerous, so shade \\nis best! \\nYou can read more specific advice and information on our separate Sun Protection for Babies and \\nChildren page. \\nTips for applying sunscreen \\nTo ensure maximum protection:  \\n• Apply sunscreen liberally to the parts of your skin that will be exposed, about 15 to 30 minutes before \\nyou go out into the sun  \\n• Reapply it to exposed skin about 15 to 30 minutes after stepping outside  \\nThe first application will give your skin time to absorb the sunscreen before sun exposure begins, and the \\nsecond will cover areas you may have missed the first time.  \\nWhen you apply it, spread it as uniformly as possible over your skin and let it dry. \\nReapply sunscreen every two hours or if you take part in any activity that could cause it to rub or wash it \\noff – for example, swimming, towel-drying, or playing sports. \\nAre sunscreens safe  \\nExpert reviews have concluded that the ingredients used in sunscreens do not pose a concern for human \\nhealth. However, although uncommon, sunscreens can occasionally cause skin irritation or a skin allergy.   \\nYear-round sunscreen use \\nYear-round sunscreen use is unnecessary in the UK, except for people with certain medical conditions. In \\nwinter months in particular the UV index does not get high enough for it to be beneficial.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Sun-protection-fact-sheet.pdf'}, page_content='Members  bad.org.uk | Patient hub  skinhealthinfo.org.uk \\nVitamin D \\nSunlight is the main source of vitamin D, necessary for healthy bones and muscles.  \\nPeople with white skin, who are most at risk of skin cancer, must balance the benefits and risks of sun \\nexposure carefully. People with black or brown skin have a much lower risk of skin cancer linked to sun \\nexposure and a much higher risk of vitamin D deficiency. As such, people with these skin tones are more \\nlikely to benefit from sun exposure. \\nFor most of us, adequate levels of vitamin D are obtained by spending time outdoors in the spring, \\nsummer and autumn going about our normal day-to-day activities, but taking care not to overexpose \\nourselves and end up with sunburn. Giving advice about how long you need to be outdoors is not very \\nhelpful as it depends on many factors such as your posture, your skin tone, what clothing you are wearing, \\nthe time of day and season, what the weather is like – sunny or cloudy – and whether you are in the shade \\nof buildings or trees. \\nVitamin D supplements can help boost vitamin D levels. In the UK, 10 micrograms (400 IU) daily is \\nrecommended for adults, although around twice that daily dose can be safely taken (800-1000 IU). In \\nchildren less than 1-year-old, 8.5 micrograms daily is recommended (SACN 2016).'),\n",

Sometimes, however, cells become abnormal \\nand\\xa0keep growing. These abnormal cells may turn into cancer.\\nIn solid cancers, such as melanoma, the abnormal cells form a mass \\nor lump called a tumour.

Benign tumours tend to grow slowly \\nand usually don’t move into other parts of the body or turn into \\ncancer. Cancerous tumours, also known as malignant tumours, have \\nthe potential to spread.

The cancer cells can break away and travel through the \\nbloodstream or lymph vessels to other parts of the body .\\nThe cancer that first develops in a tissue or organ is called the primary \\ncancer. It is considered localised cancer if it has not spread to other \\nparts of the body . If the primary cancer cells grow and form another \\ntumour at a new site, it is called a secondary cancer or metastasis. \\nA metastasis keeps the name of the original cancer.

Basal cells \\nthat have matured move up into the squamous cell layer. Here they are \\nknown as squamous cells or keratinocyte cells. Squamous cells are the \\nmain type of cell found in the epidermis.\\nBasal cell layer – This is the lowest layer of the epidermis. It contains \\nbasal cells and cells called melanocytes.

It develops in the skin cells called \\nmelanocytes (see page 6). Melanoma most often develops in areas \\nthat have been exposed to the sun. It can also start in areas that don’t \\nreceive much sun, such as the eye (uveal or ocular melanoma); nasal \\npassages, mouth and genitals (mucosal melanoma); and the soles of \\nthe feet or palms of the hands, and under the nails (acral melanoma).\\nOther types of skin cancer, called non-melanoma skin cancers or \\nkeratinocyte cancers, are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous \\ncell carcinoma (SCC). These are far more common than melanoma. \\nHowever, melanoma is considered more serious because it can \\nspread to other parts of the body , especially if not found early .\\nQ: How common is melanoma?\\nA: Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the \\nworld. Each year in Australia, almost 19,000 people are diagnosed \\nwith invasive melanoma (it has spread into the dermis, the lower \\nlayer of the skin)2. and 28,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma \\nin situ (it is only in the epidermis, the top layer).3 In Australia, \\nmelanoma is the second most common cancer in men and the third \\nmost common in women (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). \\nSigns of melanoma\\nThe ABCD and EFG rule is a tool used by doctors to help them look for \\ncharacteristics of skin damage when diagnosing melanomas.\\nABCD signs\\nAsymmetry Are the halves of each spot different? \\nBorder Are the edges uneven, scalloped or notched?\\nColour Are there differing shades and colour patches?\\nDiameter Is the spot greater than 6 mm across, or is it \\nsmaller than 6 mm but growing larger? \\nEFG signs\\nSome types of melanoma, such as nodular and desmoplastic melanomas \\n(see page 12–13), don’t fit the ABCD guidelines.\\nElevated Is it raised?\\nFirm Is it firm to touch?\\nGrowing Is it growing quickly?\\nFor an overview of what to expect at every stage of your \\ncancer\\xa0care, visit cancer.org.au/cancercareguides/melanoma. \\nThis is a short guide to what is recommended, from diagnosis \\nto treatment and beyond.'),\n",

However, adults of any age can develop new or \\nchanging spots. It is important to get to know your skin and check \\nit every 3 to 6 months (see next page).\\nSigns of melanoma\\nThe ABCD and EFG rule is a tool used by doctors to help them look for \\ncharacteristics of skin damage when diagnosing melanomas.\\nABCD signs\\nAsymmetry Are the halves of each spot different? \\nBorder Are the edges uneven, scalloped or notched?\\nColour Are there differing shades and colour patches?\\nDiameter Is the spot greater than 6 mm across, or is it \\nsmaller than 6 mm but growing larger? \\nEFG signs\\nSome types of melanoma, such as nodular and desmoplastic melanomas \\n(see page 12–13), don’t fit the ABCD guidelines.\\nElevated Is it raised?\\nFirm Is it firm to touch?\\nGrowing Is it growing quickly?'),\n",

For areas that are hard to see, use a handheld mirror \\nor\\xa0ask someone to help. It is also a good idea to take a photo of \\nyour moles and spots so that you can compare them with an older \\nphoto to see if one has changed.\\nHow melanoma looks can vary greatly . Look for spots that are new, \\ndifferent from other spots, or raised, firm and growing (see page 9). \\nIf you have lots of moles, a melanoma usually stands out and looks \\ndifferent from other moles. A melanoma is usually brown or black, \\nbut it can also be pink.\\nEven if your doctor has said a spot is benign in the past, check \\nfor any changes in shape, size or colour. If you notice a new or \\nchanging spot, get it checked as soon as possible by your doctor.\\nQ: What causes melanoma?\\nA: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the cause of most types \\nof skin cancer. If unprotected skin is exposed to the sun when the \\nUV index is 3 or above or to other UV radiation, the structure and \\nbehaviour of the cells can change. This can permanently damage \\nthe skin, and the damage builds up every time a person spends time \\nunprotected in the sun.\\nUV radiation most often comes from the sun, but it can also come \\nfrom artificial sources such as solariums (also known as tanning \\nbeds or sun lamps). Solariums are now banned for commercial use \\nin Australia because research shows that people who use solariums \\nhave a much greater risk of developing melanoma.'),\n",

You \\ncould have an inherited faulty gene \\nif 2 or more close relatives (parent, \\nsibling or child) have been diagnosed \\nwith melanoma, particularly if they \\nwere diagnosed with more than one \\nmelanoma, or if they were diagnosed \\nwith melanoma before the age of 40.\\nPeople with a strong family history \\nof melanoma should take extra care \\nwith sun protection and regularly \\ncheck their skin carefully for new \\nmoles or skin spots. From their early \\n20s, they should consider having a \\nprofessional skin check by a doctor. \\nIf you are concerned about family \\nrisk, talk to your doctor about being \\nreferred to a family cancer clinic. \\nVisit genetics.edu.au to find a family \\ncancer clinic near you.

This will reduce your risk of \\nfurther melanomas.\\nThe UV Index shows the intensity of the sun’s UV radiation. A UV \\nindex of 3 or above means that UV levels are high enough to damage \\nunprotected skin, and you need to use all 5 types of sun protection. \\nThe\\xa0recommended daily sun protection times (see previous page) are \\nthe times of day UV levels are expected to be 3 or higher. These will \\nvary according to where you live and the time of year.\\nSun exposure and vitamin D\\nUV radiation from the sun causes skin cancer, but it is also the best \\nsource of vitamin D. People need vitamin D to develop and maintain \\nstrong, healthy bones. The body can absorb only a set amount of \\nvitamin D at a time. Most people get enough vitamin D through \\nincidental exposure to the sun, while using sun protection. When the \\nUV Index is 3 or above, this may mean spending just a few minutes \\noutdoors on most days of the week, depending on where in Australia \\nyou live and the time of year. However, people with naturally very \\ndark skin tones, who do not burn, may need longer sun exposure to \\nget\\xa0enough vitamin D. \\nAfter a diagnosis of melanoma, talk to your doctor about the best \\nways to get enough vitamin D while reducing your risk of getting more \\nmelanomas. Y our doctor may advise you to limit your sun exposure \\nas much as possible when the UV Index is 3 or above. In some cases, \\nthis may mean you don’t get enough sun exposure to maintain your \\nvitamin D levels.

In descriptions of cancer, multiple terms are often conflated but have slightly different technical meanings. \\nCellular proliferation is normally a tightly controlled, cyclical process within the body. 2,6 When this process goes awry, abnormal growths may \\nbegin to form from the affected cells. 2,6 These cells, known as neoplastic cells, divide and proliferate in an unregulated manner and may lose \\ntheir specialized function and appearance, forming a mass or lump of tissue that does not function as normal tissue otherwise would. 1,2 The \\ntechnical term for this state of unregulated growth is neoplasia from the Greek roots neo, meaning “new,” and plasia, meaning “formation.”1 The \\nphysical mass that is formed is called a neoplasm, more commonly referred to as a tumor.1,2 \\nSuch abnormal growths are not necessarily cancerous. Neoplasms can be either benign or malignant, depending on their behavior and \\ncharacteristics.6 If the neoplasm is considered benign, it means it will not invade other unrelated tissues in the body. 1 Benign neoplasms, also \\nknown as benign tumors, are typically slow-growing, localized, and often do not cause any harmful symptoms.1,2\\nLipomas are a well-known example of benign neoplasia.5 Lipomas are benign tumors formed from adipocytes, also known as fat cells.5 These fatty \\ntumors can appear anywhere in the body where normal fat cells are present, making them one of the most common neoplasms found in humans.5 \\nMost lipomas are removed purely for cosmetic reasons, as they are not generally considered to be a health risk.5\\nHowever, some neoplasms may exhibit aggressive, invasive behavior and have the potential to spread to other parts of the body.1 In this case, the \\ngrowth is referred to as a malignant neoplasm, malignant tumor, or, by its common name, cancer. 1 The word cancer comes from the Latin word \\nfor crab, as malignant neoplasms were first described in historical accounts as having a crablike appearance.1\\nMalignant neoplasms pose a more serious threat to health, as they can invade nearby tissues and organs, causing damage and dysfunction. 1,6 \\nMalignant cells can break away from the primary tumor and spread to other parts of the body via the bloodstream or lymphatic system, forming \\nsecondary tumors called metastases.1,6\\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) markers may provide clinicians with valuable information to assist in differentiating benign and malignant \\nneoplasms. For example, the markers MDM2 and CDK4 may guide the differentiation between benign lipomas and malignant liposarcomas, \\ncancerous tumors of fatty tissue.3,4 More recently, p16 has been suggested as a marker to aid in this differentiation as well.3,4\\nTumor Cell Illustration\\nTo learn more about the markers listed above, please visit our website at biocare.net or call 1-800-799-9499, option #3\\n1.“Cancer Terms: Cancer, Neoplasia, Tumor, Neoplasm.” National Cancer Institute SEER Training Modules.
